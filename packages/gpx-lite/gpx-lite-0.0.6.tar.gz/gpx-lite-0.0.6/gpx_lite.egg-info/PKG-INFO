Description: # gpx-lite
        Simple parser for gps tracks, based on
        https://pypi.org/project/gpxpy/
        
        Gpx-lite is a simplified version of gpxpy, aimed to load and save data about gpx tracks, segments,
        and points from/to xml, including large .gpx files, quickly enough.
        
        Parser only collects data from trk, trkseg, and trkpt gpx tags. All other tags are ignored. 
        Resulting GPX structure contains track list - list of track segments made of track points with latitude, 
        longitude, and time.
