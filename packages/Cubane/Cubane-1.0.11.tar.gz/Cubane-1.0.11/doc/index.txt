Cubane Documentation
====================

The cubane documentation is organised into the following sections. You may want
to get right into the code by following the tutorials or deep dive into
individual topics:

* :doc:`Getting Started </tutorials/index>` gives you a quick introduction to
  cubane and what it is all about. Start here if want to find out what cubane
  is actually for. We take you by the hand through a series of step by step
  walkthroughs and tutorials.

* :doc:`Topic guides </topics/index>` discuss key topics and concepts at a
  high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

* Looking for specific information? Try the :ref:`genindex`, :ref:`modindex` or
  the `detailed table of contents`.

* :doc:`Reference guides </ref/index>` contain a technical reference for APIs and
  other aspects of Cubane. They describe how it works and how to use it but
  assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
