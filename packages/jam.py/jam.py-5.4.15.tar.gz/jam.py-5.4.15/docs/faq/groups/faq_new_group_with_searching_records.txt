============================================
How can I implement a search for a new group
============================================

By default, every new group have the div with "default-view" class as its view 
:doc:`form template </programming/interface/form_templates>`
, that is declared in the 
:doc:`index.html </programming/interface/index_html>`
file.

You can have for a new group the same view template as for catalogs, just by 
adding the name-view class to the catalogs view template

For example, The new group have "imports" item_name. Then catalogs and imports 
groups will have the same view template:

.. code-block:: html

    <div class="catalogs-view import-view">
        
    </div>
    
The initialization of search is implemeted in the on_view_form_created event 
handler in the client module of the catalogs group. You can copy the same code 
to the client module of your new group or just add the following code:

.. code-block:: js

    function on_view_form_created(item) {
        item.task.catalogs.on_view_form_created(item);
    }
