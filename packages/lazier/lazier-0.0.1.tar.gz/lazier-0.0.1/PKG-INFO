Description: # lazier
        
        lazier allows you to move faster when you are exploring how functions change with their input, this module was written because I often felt that there had to be an easier way to work in a interactive enviroment with jupyter notebooks.
        
        
        Here is a demonstration:
        Without lazier:
        
        ```python
        def foo(a,b,c,d):
            print(a)
            print(b)
            print(c)
            print(d)
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        foo(a=1,b= 2, c=3, d=4)
        ```
        
            1
            2
            3
            4
        
        
        
        ```python
        foo(d=2)
        ```
        
        
            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
            TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
        
            <ipython-input-3-9233fe4ac2c5> in <module>()
            ----> 1 foo(d=2)
            
        
            TypeError: foo() missing 3 required positional arguments: 'a', 'b', and 'c'
        
        
        
        with lazier:
        
        ```python
        from lazier import lazier
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        @lazier
        def foo(a,b,c,d):
            print(a)
            print(b)
            print(c)
            print(d)
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        foo(a=1,b= 2, c=3, d=4)
        ```
        
            1
            2
            3
            4
        
        
        Now suppose you want to see how the output of the function changed if d was 7 in the above function call, with lazier it looks like:
        
        ```python
        foo(d=7)
        ```
        
            1
            2
            3
            7
        
        
        and so on.
        ```python
        foo(a=9)
        ```
        
            9
            2
            3
            7
        
        
        
        using reset you can forget all past values that it remebers
        ```python
        foo.reset()
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        foo()
        ```
        
            foo() missing 4 required positional arguments: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'
        
        
        
        ```python
        foo(a=1, b=11, c=3)
        ```
        
            foo() missing 1 required positional argument: 'd'
        
        
        
        ```python
        foo(d=9)
        ```
        
            1
            11
            3
            9
