  releasenotes/notes/Add-called_once-property-a69546448cbd5542.yaml:
    features: [A called_once property was added to the adapter and the mocker. This
        gives us an easy way to emulate mock's assert_called_once.]
    prelude: 'Add a called_once property to the mockers.

      '
  releasenotes/notes/additional-matcher-5c5cd466a6d70080.yaml:
    features: [Allow specifying an `additional_matcher` to the mocker that will call
        a function to allow a user to add their own custom request matching logic.]
  releasenotes/notes/case-insensitive-matching-a3143221359bbf2d.yaml:
    features: [You can pass case_sensitive=True to an adapter or set `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive
        = True` globally to enable case sensitive matching.]
    fixes: ['Reported in bug \#1584008 all request matching is done in a case insensitive
        way, as a byproduct of this request history is handled in a case insensitive
        way. This can now be controlled by setting case_sensitive to True when creating
        an adapter or globally.']
    prelude: 'It is now possible to make URL matching and request history not lowercase
      the provided URLs.

      '
    upgrade: [It is recommended you add `requests_mock.mock.case_sensitive = True`
        to your base test file to globally turn on case sensitive matching as this
        will become the default in a 2.X release.]
  releasenotes/notes/fix-pytest-version-discovery-43f27e7e162ed055.yaml:
    fixes: [Fixed a bug relating to how the pytest version was being discovered that
        meant new versions of pytest were being treated as old versions and would
        receive bad configuration.]
  releasenotes/notes/fixture-extras-699a5b5fb5bd6aab.yaml: {features: 'Added ''fixture''
      to pip extras so you can install the fixture requirements with `pip install
      requests-mock[fixture]`', prelude: 'Installing the requirements for the ''fixture''
      contrib package can now be done via pip with `pip install requests-mock[fixture]`

      '}
  releasenotes/notes/py.test-2-4e7735793288ea2d.yaml:
    fixes: [The py.test plugin was broken when using py.test < 3.0. The version of
        py.test that ships in EPEL is only 2.7 so we need to make sure we support
        at least that version.]
    prelude: 'Fix py.test plugin with py.test < 3.0

  releasenotes/notes/pytest-7e35da8c5f2cd428.yaml:
    features: [Added pytest fixture for native integration into pytest projects.]
  releasenotes/notes/repo-move-15e956e1d54c048b.yaml:
    other: ['In this release the main repository was moved off of OpenStack provided

        infrastructure and onto github at

        https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock. OpenStack has been a great

        home for the project however requests-mock is a general python project with

        no specific relationship to OpenStack and the unfamiliar infrastructure was

        limiting contributes from the wider community.

    prelude: 'The primary repository is now at https://github.com/jamielennox/requests-mock

  releasenotes/notes/request-history-stream-f1d75b33adcd7e97.yaml:
    features: [The stream parameter is recorded when the request is sent and available
        in request history in the same was as parameters like verify or timeout.]
