Description: # TTCPy - Text To Columns Python
        
        This is the Python version of the original TTC package in R. The purpose of the package is to filter strings of non-frequent words and transform it to columns with the frequency of the common words.
        
        The package is not big, the three things to remember, for the moment, is:
        
        - - -
        
            1. The initial process of the class. Give it paramters such as minimum support between a value of 0 and 1. Remember, the lower the `minSup` is, the more time it will take to compute.
        
        ```
        init = TTC(data, minSup)
        ```
        The parameters:
        
        - `data`: Is the list of strings that you want to transform.
        - `minSup`: If the frequency of the word is below this value, then it is filtered out. A value between 0 and 1.
        
        - - -
        
            2. Later you can call the compute function that will compute it with the given data. The output will be a `numpy` array with the frequencies of the words.
        
        ```
        init.compute()
        ```
        - - -
        
            3. You can also call the words that is the most frequent. These words are in the same order as the output from step 2. The output will be a `numpy` array with the frequent words.
        
        ```
        init.header
        ```
        
        
        
        
        
        --- Updates for package TTCPy ---
        
        
        - 19/07/2018 - Version 0.2.0
        Introduced the `numba` module for some functions. Also took away the dependency of the module `re`.
        
        - 11/07/2018 - Version 0.1.0
        Implemented the TTC version from R to Python (TTCPy). There is not option for filtering out specific words as in the R package.
