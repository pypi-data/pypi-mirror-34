wm_dist calculates distances from points on a mesh through a volume. Distances are calculated by solving the Eikonal equation.
The primary use case for wm_dist is brain imaging for calculating distances through the cortical white matter from vertex points defined on a mesh representation of the cortical gray matter. However, in principal, any distances can be calculated through any volume from any points defined on an surface mesh.
