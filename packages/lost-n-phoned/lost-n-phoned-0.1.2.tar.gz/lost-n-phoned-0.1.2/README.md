# lost-n-phoned

Recover contact information from a stranger's phone if yours is lost or out of battery.

This was a hackathon project for CodeRED Exploration by [Bala](https://github.com/Balakumaran-Bala), [Keane](https://github.com/keanemind), [Leon](https://github.com/ljacob15), and [Max](https://github.com/rodney-moreno). The core idea is Bala's. The name is a play on the phrase "Lost-n-Found".
