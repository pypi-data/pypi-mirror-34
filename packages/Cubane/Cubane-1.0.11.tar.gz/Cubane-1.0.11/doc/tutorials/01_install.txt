Install Python
==============

Cubane is written in the Python programming language; therefore we need to make
sure that we have python up and running first.

Get the latest version of Python 2.7+ at https://www.python.org/download/ or
with your operating system's package manager.

Cubane is currently supporting the latest version of python 2.7+. At the time
of writing, this is 2.7.12 for example.


Verifying Python
================

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like:

.. parsed-literal::

    Python 2.7.x
    [GCC 4.x on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>
