def sid(net, communities, subnet=None, axis=0, calc='global', decay=None):
    """

    Segregation integration difference (SID). An estimation of each community or global difference of within versus between community strength.

    Parameters
    ----------

    net: array, dict
        Temporal network input (graphlet or contact). Allowerd nettype: 'bu', 'bd', 'wu', 'wd'

    communities :
        a Nx1 vector or NxT array of community assignment.

    subnet : array
        a Nx1 vector or NxT array  of community assignment (will be removed in v0.3.5).

    axis : int
        Dimension that is returned 0 or 1 (default 0).
        Note, only relevant for directed networks.
        i.e. if 0, node i has Aijt summed over j and t.
        and if 1, node j has Aijt summed over i and t.

    calc : str
        'global' returns temporal degree centrality (a 1xnode vector) (default);
         'community_pairs' returns a community x community x time matrix, which is the SID for each community pairing;
         'community_avg' (returns a community x time matrix). Which is the normalized average of each community to all other communities.

    decay: str
        if calc = 'time', then decay is possible where the centrality of
        the previous time point is carried over to the next time point but decays
        at a value of $e^decay$ such that the temporal centrality measure becomes: $D_d(t+1) = e^{-decay}D_d(t) + D(t+1)$.

    Returns
    -------

    sid: array
        segregation-integration difference. Format: 2d or 3d numpy array (depending on calc) representing (community,community,time) or (community,time)
