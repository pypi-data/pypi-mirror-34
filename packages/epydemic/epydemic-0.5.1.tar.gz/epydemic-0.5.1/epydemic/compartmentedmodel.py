    represents a disease as a collection of discrete :term:`compartments`, with each 
    compartment specifying some facet of the disease's progression. Nodes
    transition between compartments with some probability, so the disease's
    progression is a stochastic process in which the various nodes typically move
    through several compartments according to the probabilities defined.

    When run, a compartmented model generates results consisting of the size of each
    compartment at the end of the experiment. This can be changed by overriding the
