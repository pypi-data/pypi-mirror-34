Welcome to the Django Dance School project
==========================================

Who is this project for?
------------------------

Partnered social dance schools are complicated. They involve regular classes in multiple configurations which can have prerequisites, auditions, complex pricing, etc. There may also be public events which require registration, and often involve managing instructors, venues, scheduling and finances.

These dance schools are often run by people with limited time and resources. The founders of this project are all Lindy Hoppers, and in this community, even the most prominent and successful dance schools have zero full-time staff. Many schools are unable to grow because they lack the time and resources to manage all of the logistics, whose constraints are a disservice to the dance.

Over several years, `Boston Lindy Hop <https://bostonlindyhop.com/>`__ has sought to address these issues by building a custom registration system with all of the features needed to run a dance school. The commercial options for dance schools are often limited, inflexible, and expensive. This sofware is adaptable enough to be suited to a wide range of dance schools, partnered or otherwise.

The project is designed to be modular and adaptable to the needs to individual dance schools, and can be readily customized while maintaining full integration between the registration system and the public facing parts of the website. Unnecessary features can be turned off, and the entire system is built with a focus on simple usage and customization.

Django Dance School is integrated with `Django CMS <https://www.django-cms.org/en/>`__, which works similarly to other content management systems, making tasks like editing website content easy. Once the website is up and running, it is as straightforward to edit and maintain content as any other CMS. Best of all, this software is free and open source, so you are not stuck paying hefty service fees to a third-party registration provider.

History
-------

This project was originally created in Spring-Summer 2010 by Shawn
Hershey, for New School Swing (the predecessor to `Boston Lindy
Hop <https://bostonlindyhop.com/>`__). In March 2015, the project was
taken over by Lee Tucker and Andrew Selzer. Significant contributions
over the course of the project have also been made by Dan Rosenthal,
Jason Swihart, and Kevin Sihlanick.

Basic installation
------------------

What you need:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Python 3.4+
-  The ability to create a virtual environment (on Linux, install the
   ``python-virtualenv`` package)
-  pip - the Python package manager
-  A suitable database. For development and testing, SQLite is used by
   default, so you do not need to do anything to get started.  For production
   uss, it is **strongly Recommended** to use PostgreSQL server 9.4+
-  External library dependencies for Pillow, used for basic image
   processing (see the `Pillow
   Documentation <http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/installation.html>`__).
-  **Recommended for production use:** `Redis server <https://redis.io/>` for asynchronous handling of emails and other tasks
-  **For Paypal integration only:** SSL and FFI libraries needed to use the Paypal REST SDK (see `the Github repo <https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK>` for details)

**Linux**

-  If you are using a package manager (such as apt), you can usually
   directly install the needed dependencies for Pillow. For example, on
   Ubuntu:

   ::

       sudo apt-get install libjpeg zlib
       sudo apt-get install redis-server
       sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libffi-dev

**Mac**

-  You'll have to use homebrew to ``brew install`` dependencies above.
   Beware you may run into the zlib issue which can be `answered
   here <http://andinfinity.de/posts/2014-07-17-quick-note-homebrew-installed-python-fails-to-import-zlib.html>`_.

Basic Installation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a subfolder for your new Django project, and enter it:

   ::

       mkdir django
       cd django

2. Create a new virtual environment and enter it:

   ::

       python3 -m virtualenv .
       source bin/activate

   -  *Note:* Depending on your system, you may need to follow slightly
      modified instructions in order to create a virtual environment. No
      matter which method you use, be sure that your environment is set
      to use Python 3 by default.

3. Install the django-danceschool from `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.
   This will also install all of the necessary dependencies (which may take
   awhile)

   ``pip install django-danceschool``

   *Note:* Additionally, depending on your operating system, you may
   need to install certain program dependencies in order to install the
   Pillow package and the psycopg2 package (as listed in
   requirements.txt). If you run into issues at this step of the
   installation, look for these issues first.

4. Start your Django project, using the ``django-admin`` command.  To avoid
   having to set a large number of settings manually, we strongly recommend
   that you use the preexisting installation template as follows.  Make sure
   that you are in the folder where you would like your project to be located when you do this.

   ::

      django-admin startproject --template https://raw.githubusercontent.com/django-danceschool/django-danceschool/master/setup/default_setup.zip <your_project_name>

5. Perform initial database migrations

   ::
       
       cd <your_project_name>
       python manage.py migrate

6. Create a superuser so that you can log into the admin interface (you
   will be prompted for username and password)

   ::

       python manage.py createsuperuser

7. **Optional, but strongly recommended:** Run the easy-installer setup
   script, and follow all prompts.  This script will guide you through
   the process of setting initial values for many things, creating a few
   initial pages that many school use, and setting up user groups and
   permissions that will make it easier for you to get started running
   your dance school right away.

   ::

       python manage.py setupschool

8. Run the server and try to log in!

   ::

       python manage.py runserver


Following steps 1-8 above will give you a working installation for testing
purposes.  However, additional steps are needed to setup emails,
payment processor integration, and other automated processes.  For details,
see the Installation page of the documentation.


Contribution guidelines

- Bug fixes
- Creation and improvement of unit tests
- Documentation improvements
- Planning and implementing any significant new functionality that may be
  valuable to your dance school and also to other schools,
