Description: 
        This project is a library containing basis sets for use in quantum
        chemistry calculations.  In addition, this library has functionality
        for manipulation of basis set data.
        
        The goal of this project is to create a consistent, thoroughly curated
        database of basis sets, and to provide a standard nomenclature for
        quantum chemistry.
        
        The data contained within this library is being thoroughly evaluated
        and checked against relevant literature, software implementations, and
        other databases when available. The original data from the PNNL Basis
        Set Exchange is also available.
        
        This project is a collaboration between the Molecular Sciences Software
        Institute (http://www.molssi.org) and the Environmental Molecular Sciences
        Laboratory (https://www.emsl.pnl.gov)
