        # cavemanstats!
        
        Unnecessarily slow, brute-force search method for highest R^2 of (specified or unspecified) Linear Regression Models. 
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        What things you need to install the software and how to install them
        
        ```
        Give examples
        ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
        
        Say what the step will be
        
        ```
        pip install cavemanstats
        ```
        End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
