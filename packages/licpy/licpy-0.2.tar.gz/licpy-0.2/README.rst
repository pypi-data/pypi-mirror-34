LicPy
==========================

|Build Status|

LicPy is our implementation in Python of the  *line integral convolution* (LIC) method for visualizing vectorfields. It has TensorFlow as a dependency, and it relies on it to accelerate the image generation when a GPU is present.

The documentation is available at `dzhelil.info/licpy <https://dzhelil.info/licpy>`_.
