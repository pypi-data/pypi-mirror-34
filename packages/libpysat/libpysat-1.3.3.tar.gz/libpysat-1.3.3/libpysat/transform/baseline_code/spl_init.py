# NAME:	
#             SPL_INIT
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Given arrays X and Y of length N containing a tabulated function, i.e.
#   Yi = f(Xi), with X1 > X2 > ... > Xn, and given values YP1 and YPN for the
#   first derivative of the interpolating function at points 1 and N,
#   respectively, this routine returns and array Y2 of length N which contains
#   the second derivatives of the interpolating function at the tabulated 
#   points Xi.  If YP1 and/or YPN are equal to 1.E30 or larger, the routine 
#   is signalled to set the corresponding boundary condition for a natural 
#   spline, with zero second derivative on that boundary.
#
#   This routine is a replacement for the IDL intrinsic function
#   to be used with GDL while this latter does not have it as an
#   intrinsic.
#
#   Note that the keyword DOUBLE of the IDL intrinsic function is ignored.
#   Tests in single precision have shown that the routine is exactly
#   similar to the IDL function.
#   SPL_INTERP is also recoded similarly.
#
# SOURCE:
#	Numerical Recipes, 1986. (page 88)
# 
# CALLING SEQUENCE:
#	y2 = SPL_INIT( x, y, YP0=yp1, YPN_1=ypn)
#
# INPUTS:
#	x - independent variable vector
#	y - dependent variable vector
#	yp1 - first derivative at x(0)
#	ypn - first derivative at x(n-1)
#
# OUTPUTS:
#	y2 - second derivatives at all x, of length n
#
# HISTORY:
#	converted to IDL, D. Neill, October, 1991
#       arranged as a substitution for SPL_INIT (for use in GDL)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE:
# Name this function: spl_init to use it as a replacement of the IDL intrinsic
#      when using GDL
# But, to make a comparison of numerical results with the IDL intrinsic
# function, as it is made in the attached program: test_splf, change its
# name in "psplinf", so that IDL can execute either its intrinsic or
# the substitute.
# Anyway, this comparison has been made with success and if you just
# want to use this function in GDL ... ignore this remark
