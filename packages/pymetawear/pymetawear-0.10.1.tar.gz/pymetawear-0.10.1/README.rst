**PyMetaWear is a community developed Python SDK started by**
`Henrik Blidh <https://github.com/hbldh>`_ **. MbientLab does not provide support for this SDK.**

Python package for connecting to and using
`MbientLab's MetaWear <https://mbientlab.com/>`_ boards.


Capabilities and Limitations
----------------------------

PyMetaWear was previously a wrapper around the
`MetaWear C++ API <https://github.com/mbientlab/Metawear-CppAPI>`_,
providing a more Pythonic interface. In version 0.9.0 it instead becomes
a wrapper around `MetaWear's official Python SDK <https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-Python>`_,
doing the very same thing. The official SDK handles the actual board
connections and communication while PyMetaWear aims to remove the low level
feeling of interacting with the MetaWear board.


Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Reading data over longer periods of time.** Many users have reported disconnection problems when trying to use PyMetaWear for long periods.

Installation
------------

Due to a dependency on ``gattlib``, a Python BLE package that is
poorly maintained, MbientLab has `forked it <https://github.com/mbientlab/pygattlib>`_
and ships a patched version with its Python SDK. This makes installation of
PyMetaWear require some additional work:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/mbientlab/pygattlib.git@master#egg=gattlib
    $ pip install metawear
    $ pip install pymetawear


Documentation
-------------

Available in the `Github pages <https://hbldh.github.io/pymetawear/>`_ of this repository.

Basic Usage
-----------

The MetaWear client can be used in two ways: either as Pythonic
convenience class for handling a MetaWear board or as
a simple communication client governed by the ``libmetawear`` C++ library.

Creating a client, and thus also setting up a Bluetooth connection to the
MetaWear board, is equal for both the two usage profiles:

.. code-block:: python

    from pymetawear.client import MetaWearClient
    c = MetaWearClient('DD:3A:7D:4D:56:F0')

An example: blinking with the LED lights can be done like this with the
convenience methods:

.. code-block:: python

    pattern = c.led.load_preset_pattern('blink', repeat_count=10)
    c.led.write_pattern(pattern, 'g')
    c.led.play()

or like this using the raw ``libmetawear`` shared library:

.. code-block:: python

    from ctypes import byref
    from pymetawear import libmetawear
    from mbientlab.metawear.cbindings import LedColor, LedPreset

    pattern = Led.Pattern(repeat_count=10)
    libmetawear.mbl_mw_led_load_preset_pattern(byref(pattern), LedPreset.BLINK)
    libmetawear.mbl_mw_led_write_pattern(c.board, byref(pattern), LedColor.GREEN)
    libmetawear.mbl_mw_led_play(c.board)

Actual addresses to your MetaWear board can be found by scanning, either
directly with ``hcitool lescan`` or with the included ``discover_devices`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from pymetawear.discover import discover_devices
    out = discover_devices()
    print out
    [(u'DD:3A:7D:4D:56:F0', u'MetaWear'), (u'FF:50:35:82:3B:5A', u'MetaWear')]

See the examples folder for more examples on how to use the ``libmetawear``
library with this client.

Modules
~~~~~~~
All functionality of the MetaWear C++ API is able to be used using the
PyMetaWear client, and some of the modules have had convenience methods
added to simplify the use of them. Below are two list, one of modules which
have had their convenience methods written and one of modules that are
awaiting such focus.
