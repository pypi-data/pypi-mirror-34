Why?.
-----

When you look for an alternative to `Skitch <https://evernote.com/skitch/>`_, an
`evernote <https://evernote.com/>`_ extension which is
pretty cool everybody mentioned `Shutter <http://shutter-project.org/>`_ 
as the `best screenshot tool <http://askubuntu.com/questions/6558/what-screenshot-tools-are-available>`_
on Linux (which is true) but it needs a lot of investigation and configurations to
automate an important feature **Take the screenshot, edit it and sync it
inmediatly with access with a direct link to embed it properlly**, even if this tool
has some **upload features** they are full of marketing and noisy, with this
little set of helpers in python, you can have your own server of images in
Amazon s3 and preconfigure everything to work our of the box.

See a little demonstration of what you can do.
