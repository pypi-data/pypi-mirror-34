Description: Tibetan Phonetics Engine
        ========================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        The goal of this code is to provide a library to: - implement the
        conversion of a Tibetan Unicode word into IPA, according to different
        schemes / dialects - implement some conversions between IPA and
        phonetics readable by people with various language backgrounds (Chinese,
        English, etc.)
        
        The primary focus of this library is litterary pronounciation, ideally
        representing how an umze would pronounce a traditional text, but
        contributions for other uses are welcome. We also do not handle Sanskrit
        transliteration (this can be done through custom exceptions lists).
        
        Note that this library integrates no segmenter and needs to be applied
        on each word separately. You can use it in combination with
        `pybo <https://github.com/Esukhia/pybo/>`__ to get the phonetics of full
        sentences.
        
        Phonetics methods
        -----------------
        
        We currently provide two phonetics schemes:
        
        Manual of Standard Tibetan (by Tournadre)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Colloquial Amdo Tibetan (by Kuo-ming Sung and Lha Byams Rgyal)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Outputs
        -------
        
        Apart from raw IPA, we provide the following output possibilities:
        
        Chinese phonetics
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The Chinese is produced by a streamlined phonetic scheme in order to
        match the Mandarin phonology (vowels have been simplified and most of
        the Tibetan suffixes removed).
        
        To produce the final output, we first transform the generated IPA into
        `Zhuyin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo>`__, and then the Zhuyin
        into Traditional Chinese characters, with a manually built
        correspondance list.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This library should appear soon enough on pip.
