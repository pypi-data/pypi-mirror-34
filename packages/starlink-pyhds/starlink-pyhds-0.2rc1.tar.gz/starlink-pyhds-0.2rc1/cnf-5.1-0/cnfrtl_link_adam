#  Name:
#     cnfrtl_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against adam CNF RTL.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM
#     applications which use CNF RTL routines in order to generate the
#     correct arguments for the compiler (or ld) command. The
#     arguments generated are written to the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        alink program.f -L/star/lib `cnfrtl_link_adam`
