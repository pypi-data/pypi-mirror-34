v<1.2.0>, 2018-07-27

This release features:
* a more flexible specification for the [spatial Markov chains model](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/markov.py#L169).More specifically, for continuous time series input:
    * both the numbers of classifications for input continuous time series (k) and spatial lags (m) can be specified and allowed to be different
    * user-defined classifications (cutoffs) for input continuous time series and spatial lags are allowed
* new visualization tools:
    * relies on [pysal/splot](https://github.com/pysal/splot) for [visualizing
    Dynamic LISA related statistics](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/directional.py#L322)
* launch of the [documentation website](http://giddy.readthedocs.io/)

v<1.1.1>, 2018-05-17

This release is the first tagged release of giddy on Github.
Starting from this release, giddy supports python 3.5 and 3.6 only.
This release also features categorical spatial Markov which enables spatial Markov
(class [Spatial_Markov](https://github.com/pysal/giddy/blob/master/giddy/markov.py#L179))
to be applied to categorical time series such as land use and land cover change,
as well as neighborhood change. Here, the spatial lag (utilizing function
[lag_categorical](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal/blob/master/libpysal/weights/spatial_lag.py#L88)
in [libpysal](https://github.com/pysal/libpysal)) is defined as the most
common category among neighbors.
