Mutmut
======

Mutmut is a mutation testing library/tool. It aims to be usable as a program directly, but also to have an easy to use API.


Install
-------

.. code-block::

    pip install mutmut


Usage
-----

.. code-block::

    mutmut

This will by default run pytest on tests in the "tests" folder and it will try to figure out where the code to mutate lies. Run

.. code-block::

    mutmut --help

for the available flags, to use other runners, etc. The recommended way to use mutmut if
the defaults aren't working for you is to add a block in `setup.cfg`. Then when you 
come back to mutmut weeks later you don't have to figure out the flags again, just run 
`mutmut` and it works. Like this:

.. code-block::

    [mutmut]
    paths_to_mutate=src/
    backup=False
    runner=python -m pytest
    tests_dir=tests/
    dict_synonyms=Struct, NamedStruct

The output of the mutation tests (if you have surviving mutants) looks like:

.. code-block::

    FAILED: mutmut path/filename.py --apply --mutation "    if foo > bar:â¤‘0"

I've made is to you can just copy paste everything after "FAILED:" and run it directly and you'll get the
mutant on disk. You should REALLY have the file you mutate under source code control and committed before you mutate it!


Whitelisting
------------

You can mark lines like this:

.. code-block:: python

    some_code_here()  # pragma: no mutate

to stop mutation on those lines. Some cases we've found where you need to whitelist lines are:

- The version string on your library. You really shouldn't have a test for this :P
- Optimizing break instead of continue. The code runs fine when mutating break to continue, but it's slower.


Example mutations
-----------------

- Integer literals are changed by adding 1. So 0 becomes 1, 5 becomes 6, etc.
- < is changed to <=
- break is changed to continue and vice versa

In general the idea is that the mutations should be as subtle as possible. See `__init__.py` for the full list.
