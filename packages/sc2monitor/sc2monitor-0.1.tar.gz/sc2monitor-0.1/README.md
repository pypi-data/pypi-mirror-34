sc2monitor.init(host='mysql-host',
                user='mysql-user',
                passwd='mysql-password',
                db='mysql-database')

```python
import sc2monitor

sc2monitor.init(host='mysql-host',
                user='mysql-user',
                passwd='mysql-password',
                db='mysql-database')
sc2monitor.run()
```
You can add players to monitor either by their sc2_player_id (and realm) or by their Battletag via executing, e.g., `sc2monitor.add_player(player_id=221986, realm=1)` or `sc2monitor.add_player(battle_tag='pressure#2380')`, or by adding a row into player MySQL table with either `sc2_player_id` or `battle_tag` entered.
