*Save your dotfiles once, deploy them everywhere*

Dotdrop makes the management of dotfiles between different hosts easy.
It allows to store your dotfiles on git and automagically deploy
different versions on different setups.

For example you can have a set of dotfiles for your home laptop and a
different set for your office desktop. Those sets may overlap and
different versions of the same dotfile can be deployed on different
predefined *profiles*. Another use case is when you have a main set of
dotfiles for your everyday’s host and a sub-set you only need to deploy
to temporary hosts (cloud VM, etc) that may be using a slightly
different version of some of the dotfiles.

Features:

-  Sync once every dotfile on git for different usages
-  Allow dotfiles templating by leveraging
   `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__
-  Comparison between local and stored dotfiles
-  Handling multiple profiles with different sets of dotfiles
-  Easy import dotfiles
-  Handle files and directories
-  Associate an action to the deployment of specific dotfiles
-  Associate transformations that allow to store encrypted dotfiles

dotdrop <#people-using-dotdrop>`__ for more.

Quick start:

.. code:: bash

   mkdir dotfiles && cd dotfiles
   git init
   git submodule add https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop.git
   ./dotdrop/bootstrap.sh
   ./dotdrop.sh --help

A mirror of this repository is available on gitlab under
https://gitlab.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop.

Why dotdrop ?
-------------

There exist many tools to manage dotfiles however not many allow to
deploy different versions of the same dotfile on different hosts.
Moreover dotdrop allows to specify the set of dotfiles that need to be
deployed on a specific profile.

See the `example <#example>`__ for a concrete example on why dotdrop
rocks.

Installation
============

There are two ways of installing and using dotdrop, either `as a
submodule <#as-a-submodule>`__ to your dotfiles git tree or system-wide
`with pypi <#with-pypi>`__.

Having dotdrop as a submodule guarantees that anywhere your are cloning
your dotfiles git tree from you’ll have dotdrop shipped with it. It is
the recommended way.

Dotdrop is also available on aur: \* stable:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotdrop/ \* git version:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dotdrop-git/

As a submodule
--------------

The following will create a repository for your dotfiles and keep
dotdrop as a submodules:

.. code:: bash

   $ mkdir dotfiles; cd dotfiles
   $ git init
   $ git submodule add https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop.git
   $ sudo pip3 install -r dotdrop/requirements.txt
   $ ./dotdrop/bootstrap.sh
   $ ./dotdrop.sh --help

Install the requirements with:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo pip3 install -r dotdrop/requirements.txt

For MacOS users, make sure to install ``realpath`` through homebrew
(part of *coreutils*).

Using this solution will need you to work with dotdrop by using the
generated script ``dotdrop.sh`` at the root of your dotfiles repository.

Finally import your dotfiles as described `below <#usage>`__.

With pypi
---------

Start by installing dotdrop

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo pip3 install dotdrop

And then create a repository for your dotfiles

.. code:: bash

   $ mkdir dotfiles; cd dotfiles
   $ git init

To avoid the need to provide the config file path to dotdrop each time
it is called, you can create an alias:

::

   alias dotdrop='dotdrop --cfg=<path-to-your-config.yaml>'

Replace any call to ``dotdrop.sh`` in the documentation below by
``dotdrop`` if using the pypi solution.

Finally import your dotfiles as described `below <#usage>`__.

Usage
=====

If starting fresh, the ``import`` command of dotdrop allows to easily
and quickly get a running setup.

Install dotdrop on one of your host and then import any dotfiles you
want dotdrop to manage (be it a file or a directory):

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh import ~/.vimrc ~/.xinitrc

Dotdrop does two things:

-  Copy the dotfiles in the *dotfiles* directory
-  Create the entries in the *config.yaml* file

Commit and push your changes.

Then go to another host where your dotfiles need to be managed as well,
clone the previously setup git tree and compare local dotfiles with the
ones stored by dotdrop:

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh list
   $ dotdrop.sh compare --profile=<other-host-profile>

Then adapt any dotfile using the `template <#template>`__ feature and
set a new profile for the current host by simply adding lines in the
config files, for example:

.. code:: yaml

   ...
   profiles:
     host1:
       dotfiles:
       - f_vimrc
       - f_xinitrc
     host2:
       dotfiles:
       - f_vimrc
   ...

When done, you can install your dotfiles using

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh install

That’s it, a single repository with all your dotfiles for your different
hosts.

For more options see ``dotdrop.sh --help``.

For easy deployment the default profile used by dotdrop reflects the
hostname of the host on which it runs.

Install dotfiles
----------------

Simply run

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh install

Use the ``--profile`` switch to specify a profile if not using the
host’s hostname.

Compare dotfiles
----------------

Compare local dotfiles with dotdrop’s defined ones:

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh compare

The diffing is done by diff in the backend, one can provide specific
options to diff using the ``-o`` switch.

Import dotfiles
---------------

Dotdrop allows to import dotfiles directly from the filesystem. It will
copy the dotfile and update the config file automatically.

For example to import ``~/.xinitrc``

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh import ~/.xinitrc

You can control how the dotfile key is generated in the config file with
the option ``longkey`` (per default to *false*).

Two formats are available:

-  short format (default): take the shortest unique path
-  long format: take the full path

For example ``~/.config/awesome/rc.lua`` gives

-  ``f_rc.lua`` in the short format
-  ``f_config_awesome_rc.lua`` in the long format

Importing ``~/.mutt/colors`` and ``~/.vim/colors`` will result in

-  ``d_colors`` and ``d_vim_colors`` in the short format
-  ``d_mutt_colors`` and ``d_vim_colors`` in the long format

List profiles
-------------

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh list

Dotdrop allows to choose which profile to use with the *–profile* switch
if you use something else than the default (the hostname).

List dotfiles
-------------

The following command lists the different dotfiles configured for a
specific profile:

.. code:: bash

   $ dotdrop.sh listfiles --profile=<some-profile>

For example:

::

   Dotfile(s) for profile "some-profile":

   f_vimrc (file: "vimrc", link: False)
       -> ~/.vimrc
   f_dunstrc (file: "config/dunst/dunstrc", link: False)
       -> ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc

Use actions
-----------

It is sometimes useful to execute some kind of action when deploying a
dotfile. For example let’s consider
`Vundle <https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim>`__ is used to manage
vim’s plugins, the following action could be set to update and install
the plugins when ``vimrc`` is deployed:

.. code:: yaml

   actions:
     vundle: vim +VundleClean! +VundleInstall +VundleInstall! +qall
   config:
     backup: true
     create: true
     dotpath: dotfiles
   dotfiles:
     f_vimrc:
       dst: ~/.vimrc
       src: vimrc
       actions:
         - vundle
   profiles:
     home:
       dotfiles:
       - f_vimrc

Thus when ``f_vimrc`` is installed, the command
``vim +VundleClean! +VundleInstall +VundleInstall! +qall`` will be
executed.

Sometimes, you may even want to execute some action prior to deploying a
dotfile. Let’s take another example with
`vim-plug <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>`__:

.. code:: yaml

   actions:
     pre:
       vim-plug-install: test -e ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim || (mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload; curl
         -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim)
     vim-plug: vim +PlugInstall +qall
   config:
     backup: true
     create: true
     dotpath: dotfiles
   dotfiles:
     f_vimrc:
       dst: ~/.vimrc
       src: vimrc
       actions:
          - vim-plug-install
          - vim-plug
   profiles:
     home:
       dotfiles:
       - f_vimrc

This way, we make sure
`vim-plug <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>`__ is installed prior
to deploying the ``~/.vimrc`` dotfile.

Note that ``pre`` actions are always executed even if the dotfile is not
installed.

You can also define ``post`` actions like this:

.. code:: yaml

   actions:
     post:
       some-action: echo "Hello, World!" >/tmp/log

If you don’t specify neither ``post`` nor ``pre``, the action will be
executed after the dotfile deployment (which is equivalent to ``post``).
Actions cannot obviously be named ``pre`` or ``post``.

Use transformations
-------------------

Transformation actions are used to transform a dotfile before it is
installed. They work like `actions <#use-actions>`__ but are executed
before the dotfile is installed to transform the source.

Transformation commands have two arguments:

-  **{0}** will be replaced with the dotfile to process
-  **{1}** will be replaced with a temporary file to store the result of
   the transformation

A typical use-case for transformations is when the dotfile needs to be
stored encrypted.

Here’s an example of part of a config file to use gpg encrypted
dotfiles:

.. code:: yaml

   dotfiles:
     f_secret:
       dst: ~/.secret
       src: secret
       trans:
         - gpg
   trans:
     gpg: gpg2 -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d {0} > {1}

The above config allows to store the dotfile ``~/.secret`` encrypted in
the *dotfiles* directory and uses gpg to decrypt it when install is run.

Here’s how to deploy the above solution:

-  import the clear dotfile (creates the correct entries in the config
   file)

.. code:: bash

   ./dotdrop.sh import ~/.secret

-  encrypt the original dotfile

.. code:: bash

   <some-gpg-command> ~/.secret

-  overwrite the dotfile with the encrypted version

.. code:: bash

   cp <encrypted-version-of-secret> dotfiles/secret

-  edit the config file and add the transformation to the dotfile
-  commit and push the changes

Note that transformations cannot be used if the dotfiles is to be linked
(``link: true``) and ``compare`` won’t work on dotfiles using
transformations.

Update dotdrop
--------------

If used as a submodule, update it with

.. code:: bash

   $ git submodule foreach git pull origin master
   $ git add dotdrop
   $ git commit -m 'update dotdrop'
   $ git push

Through pypi:

.. code:: bash

   $ sudo pip3 install dotdrop --upgrade

Update dotfiles
---------------

Dotfiles managed by dotdrop can be updated using the ``update`` command.
There are two cases:

-  the dotfile doesn’t use `templating <#template>`__: the new version
   of the dotfile is copied to the *dotfiles* directory and overwrites
   the old version. If git is used to version the dotfiles stored by
   dotdrop, the git command ``diff`` can be used to view the changes.
-  the dotfile uses `templating <#template>`__: the dotfile must be
   manually updated, the use of the dotdrop command ``compare`` can be
   helpful to identify the changes to apply to the template.

::

   $ dotdrop.sh update ~/.vimrc

Store sensitive dotfiles
------------------------

Two solutions exist, the first one using an unversioned file (see
`Environment variables <#environment-variables>`__) and the second using
transformations (see `Transformations <#use-transformations>`__).

Config
======

The config file (defaults to *config.yaml*) is a yaml file containing
the following entries:

-  **config** entry: contains settings for the deployment

   -  ``backup``: create a backup of the dotfile in case it differs from
      the one that will be installed by dotdrop (default *true*)
   -  ``create``: create directory hierarchy when installing dotfiles if
      it doesn’t exist (default *true*)
   -  ``dotpath``: path to the directory containing the dotfiles to be
      managed by dotdrop (absolute path or relative to the config file
      location)
   -  ``banner``: display the banner (default *true*)
   -  ``longkey``: use long keys for dotfiles when importing (default
      *false*)
   -  ``keepdot``: preserve leading dot when importing hidden file in
      the ``dotpath`` (default *false*)
   -  ``link_by_default``: when importing a dotfile set ``link`` to that
      value per default (default *false*)

-  **dotfiles** entry: a list of dotfiles

   -  When ``link`` is true, dotdrop will create a symlink instead of
      copying. Template generation (as in `template <#template>`__) is
      not supported when ``link`` is true (default *false*).
   -  ``actions`` contains a list of action keys that need to be defined
      in the **actions** entry below.
   -  ``trans`` contains a list of transformation keys that need to be
      defined in the **trans** entry below.

   ::

      <dotfile-key-name>:
        dst: <where-this-file-is-deployed>
        src: <filename-within-the-dotpath>
        # Optional
        link: <true|false>
        actions:
          - <action-key>
        trans:
          - <transformation-key>

-  **profiles** entry: a list of profiles with the different dotfiles
   that need to be managed

   -  ``dotfiles``: the dotfiles associated to this profile
   -  ``include``: include all dotfiles from another profile (optional)

::

     <some-name-usually-the-hostname>:
       dotfiles:
       - <some-dotfile-key-name-defined-above>
       - <some-other-dotfile-key-name>
       - ...
       # Optional
       include:
       - <some-other-profile>
       - ...

-  **actions** entry: a list of action

::

     <action-key>: <command-to-execute>

-  **trans** entry: a list of transformations

::

     <trans-key>: <command-to-execute>

All dotfiles for a profile
--------------------------

To use all defined dotfiles for a profile, simply use the keyword
``ALL``.

For example:

.. code:: yaml

   dotfiles:
     f_xinitrc:
       dst: ~/.xinitrc
       src: xinitrc
     f_vimrc:
       dst: ~/.vimrc
       src: vimrc
   profiles:
     host1:
       dotfiles:
       - ALL
     host2:
       dotfiles:
       - f_vimrc

Include dotfiles from another profile
-------------------------------------

If one profile is using the entire set of another profile, one can use
the ``include`` entry to avoid redundancy.

For example:

.. code:: yaml

   profiles:
     host1:
         dotfiles:
           - f_xinitrc
         include:
           - host2
     host2:
         dotfiles:
           - f_vimrc

Here profile *host1* contains all the dotfiles defined for *host2* plus
``f_xinitrc``.

Template
========

Dotdrop leverage the power of `jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ to
handle the templating of dotfiles. See `jinja2 template
doc <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/>`__ or the `example
section <#example>`__ for more information on how to template your
dotfiles.

Note that dotdrop uses different delimiters than
`jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__\ ’s defaults:

-  block start = ``{%@@``
-  block end = ``@@%}``
-  variable start = ``{{@@``
-  variable end = ``@@}}``
-  comment start = ``{#@@``
-  comment end = ``@@#}``

Available variables
-------------------

-  ``{{@@ profile @@}}`` contains the profile provided to dotdrop.
-  ``{{@@ env['MY_VAR'] @@}}`` contains environment variables (see
   `Environment variables <#environment-variables>`__)

Environment variables
---------------------

It’s possible to access environment variables inside the templates. This
feature can be used like this:

::

   {{@@ env['MY_VAR'] @@}}

This allows for storing host-specific properties and/or secrets in
environment variables.

You can have an ``.env`` file in the directory where your
``config.yaml`` lies:

::

   ## My variables for this host
   var1="some value"
   var2="some other value"

   ## Some secrets
   pass="verysecurepassword"

Of course, this file should not be tracked by git (put it in your
``.gitignore``).

Then you can invoke dotdrop with the help of an alias when using dotdrop
as a submodule:

::

   alias dotdrop='eval $(grep -v "^#" ~/dotfiles/.env) ~/dotfiles/dotdrop.sh'

When using dotdrop from pypi or aur, the absolute path to the binary
should be used in the alias to avoid recursion issues

::

   alias dotdrop='eval $(grep -v "^#" ~/dotfiles/.env) /usr/bin/dotdrop --cfg=~/dotfiles/config.yaml'

The above aliases load all the variables from ``~/dotfiles/.env`` (while
omitting lines starting with ``#``) before calling dotdrop.

Example
=======

Let’s consider two hosts:

-  **home**: home computer with hostname *home*
-  **office**: office computer with hostname *office*

The home computer is running `awesomeWM <https://awesomewm.org/>`__ and
the office computer `bspwm <https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm>`__.
The *.xinitrc* file will therefore be different while still sharing some
lines. Dotdrop allows to store only one single *.xinitrc* but to deploy
different versions depending on where it is run from.

The following file is the dotfile stored in dotdrop containing jinja2
directives for the deployment based on the profile used.

Dotfile ``<dotpath>/xinitrc``:

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/bash

   # load Xresources
   userresources=$HOME/.Xresources
   if [ -f "$userresources" ]; then
         xrdb -merge "$userresources" &
   fi

   # launch the wm
   {%@@ if profile == "home" @@%}
   exec awesome
   {%@@ elif profile == "office" @@%}
   exec bspwm
   {%@@ endif @@%}

The *if branch* will define which part is deployed based on the hostname
of the host on which dotdrop is run from.

And here’s how the config file looks like with this setup. Of course any
combination of the dotfiles (different sets) can be done if more
dotfiles have to be deployed.

``config.yaml`` file:

.. code:: yaml

   config:
     backup: true
     create: true
     dotpath: dotfiles
   dotfiles:
     f_xinitrc:
       dst: ~/.xinitrc
       src: xinitrc
   profiles:
     home:
       dotfiles:
       - f_xinitrc
     office:
       dotfiles:
       - f_xinitrc

Installing the dotfiles (the ``--profile`` switch is not needed if the
hostname matches the *profile* entry in the config file):

.. code:: bash

   # on home computer
   $ dotdrop.sh install --profile=home

   # on office computer
   $ dotdrop.sh install --profile=office

Comparing the dotfiles:

.. code:: bash

   # on home computer
   $ dotdrop.sh compare

   # on office computer
   $ dotdrop.sh compare
