This class is used for downloading files from the internet via http or ftp.
It supports basic http authentication and ftp accounts, and supports resuming downloads. 
It does not support https or sftp at this time.

The main advantage of this class is it's ease of use, and pure pythoness. It only uses the Python standard library, 
so no dependencies to deal with, and no C to compile.

#####
If a non-standard port is needed just include it in the url (http://example.com:7632).

Basic usage:
    Simple
        downloader = fileDownloader.DownloadFile('http://example.com/file.zip')
        downloader.download()
     Use full path to download
         downloader = fileDownloader.DownloadFile('http://example.com/file.zip', "C:/Users/username/Downloads/newfilename.zip")
         downloader.download()
     Basic Authentication protected download
         downloader = fileDownloader.DownloadFile('http://example.com/file.zip', "C:/Users/username/Downloads/newfilename.zip", ('username','password'))
         downloader.download()
     Resume
         downloader = fileDownloader.DownloadFile('http://example.com/file.zip')
        downloader.resume()
