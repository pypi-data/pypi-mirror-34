class Topology:
    """Base class for creating headless Keras computation graphs with arbitrary architecture.

    Input layer is pre-defined, and resides in `self.input`,
    to be used by user-defined child method.
    Child init methods are not required.

    Any parameters required by the graph definition, e.g. layer sizes, should be made
    parameters for the `define_graph` method. They will become the initialization
    parameters of the class.
    For example, if you wanted `layer_sizes, activation` to be the parameters required
    to define the model, you would make those the parameters of the
    child method `define_graph`, and then initialize
    the object with `Topology(layer_sizes, activation)`.

    ----------
    **define_graph_kwargs
        kwargs to be passed to define_graph method.
