/* Description:								    */
/*    This function unmaps all or part of a sequence of blocks from a	    */
/*    container file which have previously been mapped for access using	    */
/*    rec1_map_frame.							    */

/* Parameters:								    */
/*    int slot								    */
/*       Slot number of the container file in the File Control Vector.	    */
/*    int bloc								    */
/*	 Number of the first container file block in the mapped frame (the  */
/*	 first block in the file is no.1).				    */
/*    int length							    */
/*	 Length of the mapped frame in unsigned chars.			    */
/*    int offset							    */
/*       Offset into the first block at which the mapped access starts	    */
/*	 (zero based, in unsigned chars).				    */
/*    char mode								    */
/*       Symbol giving the access mode with which the frame was originally  */
/*	 accessed: 'R' for read access, 'U' for update access, 'W' for	    */
/*	 write access and 'Z' for demand zero access.			    */
/*    unsigned char **pntr						    */
/*	 Pointer to a pointer to the first mapped unsigned char in memory.  */
/*	 A null pointer value is returned.				    */

/* Returned Value:							    */
/*    int rec1_unmap_frame						    */
/*	 The global status value current on exit.			    */

/* Notes:								    */
/*    -  This routine attempts to execute even if the HDS global status is  */
/*    set on entry, although no further error report will be made if it	    */
/*    subsequently fails under these circumstances.			    */
/*    -  Care should be taken that the pointer supplied is valid, since an  */
/*    invalid pointer value may not be detected by this routine. The	    */
/*    routine returns without action if *pntr is null.			    */
/*    -  The value of the global switch hds_gl_map when this routine is	    */
/*    called should be the same as its value when the corresponding call to */
/*    rec1_map_frame was made. This is to ensure that the same method of    */
/*    frame access (I/O or file mapping) is used in both cases.		    */

/*	 Original version, re-write of earlier routine.			    */
/*    3-MAY-1991 (RFWS):						    */
/*	 Removed the assumption of page-aligned data by adding the bloc and */
/*	 offset arguments and passing the length argument in unsigned chars */
/*	 instead of blocks.						    */
/*    3-MAY-1991 (RFWS):						    */
/*       Added the mode argument.					    */
/*    8-MAY-1991 (RFWS):						    */

/*	 Changed to cope with "demand zero" access mode.		    */
/*    28-JUN-1991 (RFWS):						    */
/*       Added function prototype for VMS system call.			    */

/*	 Added VMS I/O based version.					    */
/*    4-JUL-1991 (RFWS):						    */
/*       Added no action if a null pointer value is supplied.		    */
/*    19-DEC-1991 (RFWS):						    */
/*       Changed VMS implementation to save freed virtual addresses for	    */
