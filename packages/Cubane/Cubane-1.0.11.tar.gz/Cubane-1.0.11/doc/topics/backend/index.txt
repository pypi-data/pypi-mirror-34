Backend System
==============

Cubane provides a backend system that allows content authors to manage content
very effectively and easily. Various components are integrating themselves into
the backend system, such as the content management system or the media system.

However, you can also use Cubane's backend system without any other components
on its own if you require a quick and effective way to build a backend system
for your data.

Of course, Django provides an excellent admin interface by itself, which can be
used instead of or beside Cubane's admin interface. However, when it comes to
managing content management data or media assets, those components will not
integrate with Django's admin interface automatically in the way they integrate
with Cubane's backend system.
