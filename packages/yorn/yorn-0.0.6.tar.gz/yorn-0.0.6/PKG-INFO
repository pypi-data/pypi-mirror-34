Description: # GET A BINARY RESPONSE TO A QUESTION
        
        A very boring input reading package/library. Takes a question string as an
        argument and returns true if y or yes is entered, false if n or no is entered,
        quits if q or quit is entered, and asks again if anything else is entered.
        
        *Entered characters are case insensitive, but you must enter the correct
        spelling or the first character of the word.*
        
        I find this useful for getting user input in a script and got tired of
        re-writing it in every program so decided to create a package for it.
