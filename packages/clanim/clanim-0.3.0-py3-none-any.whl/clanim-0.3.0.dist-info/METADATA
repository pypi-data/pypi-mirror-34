        ### Overview
        `clanim` is a collection of made command line animations that can easily
        be applied to pretty much any (non-recursive) function. The animations are
        built with the [`clanimtk`](https://github.com/slarse/clanimtk) package, and
        are mostly meant to serve as examples of how to use it.
        
        ### Requirements
        
        Python 3.6 or higher and the `clanimtk` package.
        
        ### Quickstart
        
        Here are som minimal examples of using `clanim`:
        
        ```python
        import time
        from clanimtk import animate
        from clanim import scrolling_text
        
        # if no parameter is given, the default arrow animation is used
        @animate
        def slow(n):
            time.sleep(n)
        
        # scrolling_text is a large, scrolling text animation
        # step determines the time between frames
        @animate(animation=scrolling_text("Crunching numbers ..."), step=0.05)
        def fibo(n):
            if n < 0:
                raise ValueError("Undefined for n < 0")
            fibo_recursive(n)
        
        # this recursive function must be wrapped in a non-recursive function
        # before it can be animated
        def fibo_recursive(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return n
            return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)
        ```
        
        ### Install
        
        #### Option 1: Install from PyPi with `pip`
        
        The latest release of `clanim` is on PyPi, and can thus be installed as with
        `pip install clanim` (with your own preferred options, of course).
        
        #### Option 2: Clone the repo and the install with `pip`
        
        If you want the dev version, you will need to clone the repo, as only release
        versions are uploaded to PyPi. Unless you are planning to work on this
        yourself, I suggest going with the release version.
        
        1. Clone the repo with `git`:
            - `git clone https://github.com/slarse/clanim`
        2. `cd` into the project root directory and install with `pip`.
            - `pip install --user .`, this will create a local install for the current user.
            - Or just `pip install .` if you use `virtualenv`.
            - For development, use `pip install -e .` in a `virtualenv`.
        
        ### Wanted improvements
        
        * Add more animations

        file for specifics.
        
        ### Contributing
        
        I will happily take contributions, especially in terms of new animations.
        Submit a pull request if you have an idea, and let me approve the idea before
        you put serious work into something I would not like in the project!
