        ====================
        visaplan.plone.tools
        ====================
        
        General tools modules for Plone.
        
        We don't claim ultimate Plone wisdom (yet); the main purpose of this package is
        to factor out functionality from a big monolithic product into packages.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Modules in version 1.0:
        
        - ``cfg`` module
        
          Read "product" configuration, and detect development mode
        
        - ``context`` module
        
          Several tools for processing the request.
          Some need some modernization ...
        
        - ``functions`` module
        
          Some functions, e.g. ``is_uid_shaped``
        
        - ``log`` module
        
          Automatically named loggers
        
        - ``setup`` module (since v1.1)
        
          Functions for use in migration scripts
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The modules are documented by doctests.
        Full documentation for end users can be found in the "docs" folder.
        
        
        Translations
        ------------
        
        This product has been translated into
        
        - Klingon (thanks, K'Plai)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Since ``visaplan.plone.tools`` is a package for Plone instances,
        it is not normally installed using ``pip``;
        instead, install it by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                visaplan.plone.tools
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``
