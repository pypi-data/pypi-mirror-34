# cfman

`cfman` pages are like `man` pages but for HTTP status codes. Most web developers spend considerable time looking at response codes (usually errors) and then Googling what they mean. But with `cfman`, you can simply run `$ cfman [status_code]` and get a quick explanation of your HTTP response â€“ without leaving the terminal.
