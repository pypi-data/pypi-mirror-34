class Simulation(Economy):
    r"""Simulation of synthetic BLP data.

    All data are either loaded or simulated during initialization, except for Bertrand-Nash prices and shares, which are
    computed by :meth:`Simulation.solve`.

    Unspecified exogenous variables that are used to formulate product characteristics in :math:`X_1`, :math:`X_2`, and
    :math:`X_3`, as well as agent demographics, :math:`d`, are all drawn from independent standard uniform
    distributions.

    Unobserved demand- and supply-side product characteristics, :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`, are drawn from a
    mean-zero bivariate normal distribution.

    After variables are loaded or simulated, any unspecified nodes and weights are constructed according to an
    integration configuration. Next, some simple instruments are computed:

    .. math:: Z_D = [1, X, \mathrm{Rival}(X_D), \mathrm{Other}(X_D)]

    and

    .. math:: Z_S = [1, X, \mathrm{Rival}(X_S), \mathrm{Other}(X_S)],

    in which :math:`X` are all non-constant exogenous numerical product variables, :math:`X_D` are all variables in
    :math:`X` used to formulate :math:`X_1` and :math:`X_2`, :math:`X_S` are all variables in :math:`X` used to
    formulate :math:`X_3`, and both :math:`\mathrm{Rival}` and :math:`\mathrm{Other}` are defined in
    :func:`build_blp_instruments`, which is used to construct the traditional BLP instruments.

    .. note::

       These instruments are constructed only for convenience. Especially for more complicated formulations, instrument
       fields in simulated product data should be replaced with better instruments.

    In both `product_data` and `agent_data`, fields with multiple columns can be either matrices or can be broken up
    into multiple one-dimensional fields with column index suffixes that start at zero. For example, if there are two
    columns of firm IDs, the `firm_ids` field, which in this case should be a matrix with two columns, can be replaced
    by two one-dimensional fields: `firm_ids0` and `firm_ids1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    product_formulations : `tuple`
        Tuple of three :class:`Formulation` configurations for the matrix of linear product characteristics,
        :math:`X_1`, for the matrix of nonlinear product characteristics, :math:`X_2`, and for the matrix of cost
        characteristics, :math:`X_3`, respectively. If the formulation for :math:`X_2` is ``None``, the Logit model will
        be simulated.

        The ``shares`` variable should not be included in any of the formulations and ``prices`` should be included in
        the formulation for :math:`X_1` or :math:`X_2` (or both). Any additional variables that cannot be loaded from
        `product_data` will be drawn from independent standard uniform distributions. Unlike in :class:`Problem`, fixed
        effect absorption is not supported during simulation.

    beta : `array-like`
        Vector of demand-side linear parameters, :math:`\beta`. Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_1`, which
        is formulated according to `product_formulations`.
    sigma : `array-like`
        Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix that measures agents' random taste distribution, :math:`\Sigma`,
        which is a square matrix with a lower triangle of all zeros. Rows and columns correspond to columns in
        :math:`X_2`, which is formulated according to `product_formulations`. If the formulation for :math:`X_2` is
        ``None``, this should be ``None`` as well.
    gamma : `array-like`
        Vector of supply-side linear parameters, :math:`\gamma`. Elements correspond to columns in :math:`X_3`, which
        is formulated according to `product_formulations`.
    product_data : `structured array-like`
        Each row corresponds to a product. Markets can have differing numbers of products. The convenience function
        :func:`build_id_data` can be used to construct the following required ID data from market, product, and firm
        counts:

            - **market_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with markets.

            - **firm_ids** : (`object`) - IDs that associate products with firms. Any columns after the first can be
              used in :meth:`Simulation.solve` to compute Bertrand-Nash prices and shares after firm changes, such as
              mergers.

        Custom ownership matrices can be specified as well:

            - **ownership** : (`numeric, optional') - Custom stacked :math:`J_t \times J_t` ownership matrices,
              :math:`O`, for each market :math:`t`, which can be built with :func:`build_ownership`. By default,
              standard ownership matrices are built only when they are needed. If specified, each stack is associated
              with a `firm_ids` column and must have as many columns as there are products in the market with the most
              products.

        Along with `market_ids` and `firm_ids`, the names of any additional fields can be used as variables
        in `product_formulations`.

    agent_formulation : `Formulation, optional`
        :class:`Formulation` configuration for the matrix of observed agent characteristics called demographics,
        :math:`d`, which will only be included in the model if this formulation is specified. Any variables that cannot
        be loaded from `agent_data` will be drawn from independent standard uniform distributions.
    pi : `array-like, optional`
        Parameters that measure how agent tastes vary with demographics, :math:`\Pi`. Rows correspond to the same
        product characteristics as in `sigma`. Columns correspond to to columns in :math:`d`, which is formulated
        according to `agent_formulation`.
    agent_data : `structured array-like, optional`
        Each row corresponds to an agent. Markets can have differing numbers of agents. Since simulated agents are only
        used if there are nonlinear product characteristics, agent data should only be specified if :math:`X_2` is
        formulated in `product_formulations`. If agent data are specified, market IDs are required:

            - **market_ids** : (`object, optional`) - IDs that associate agents with markets. The set of distinct IDs
              should be the same as the set of IDs in `product_data`. If `integration` is specified, there must be at
              least as many rows in each market as the number of nodes and weights that are built for each market.

        If `integration` is not specified, the following fields are required:

            - **weights** : (`numeric, optional`) - Integration weights, :math:`w`.

            - **nodes** : (`numeric, optional`) - Unobserved agent characteristics called integration nodes,
              :math:`\nu`. If there are more than :math:`K_2` columns, only the first :math:`K_2` will be used.

        Along with `market_ids`, the names of any additional fields can be used as variables in `agent_formulation`.

    integration : `Integration, optional`
        :class:`Integration` configuration for how to build nodes and weights for integration over agent utilities,
        which will replace any `nodes` and `weights` fields in `agent_data`. This configuration is required if `nodes`
        and `weights` in `agent_data` are not specified. It should not be specified if :math:`X_2` is not formulated
        in `product_formulations`.
    xi_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of the unobserved demand-side product characteristics, :math:`\xi`. The default value is ``1.0``.
    omega_variance : `float, optional`
        Variance of the unobserved supply-side product characteristics, :math:`\omega`. The default value is ``1.0``.
    correlation : `float, optional`
        Correlation between :math:`\xi` and :math:`\omega`. The default value is ``0.9``.
    costs_type : `str, optional`
        Marginal cost specification. The following specifications are supported:

            - ``'linear'`` (default) - Linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = c`.

            - ``'log'`` - Log-linear specification: :math:`\tilde{c} = \log c`.

    seed : `int, optional`
        Passed to :class:`numpy.random.RandomState` to seed the random number generator before data are simulated. By
        default, a seed is not passed to the random number generator.

    ``weight``, along with a demographic, ``income``, are simulated; unobserved agent data are constructed according to
    a low-level Gauss-Hermite product rule.

        r"""Compute Bertrand-Nash prices and shares.

        Prices and shares are computed by iterating market-by-market over the :math:`\zeta`-markup equation from
        :ref:`Morrow and Skerlos (2011) <ms11>`,

        .. math:: p^* \leftarrow c + \zeta(p^*).

        Parameters
        ----------
        firms_index : `int, optional`
            Column index of the firm IDs in the `firm_ids` field of `product_data` in :class:`Simulation` that defines
            which firms produce which products. If an `ownership` field was specified, the corresponding stack of
            ownership matrices will be used. By default, unchanged firm IDs are used.
        prices : `array-like, optional`
            Prices at which the fixed point iteration routine will start. By default, marginal costs, :math:`c`, are
            used as starting values.
        iteration : `Iteration, optional`
            :class:`Iteration` configuration for how to solve the fixed point problem. By default,
            ``Iteration('simple', {'tol': 1e-12})`` is used.
        error_behavior : `str, optional`
            How to handle errors when computing prices and shares. For example, the fixed point routine may not converge
            if the effects of nonlinear parameters on price overwhelm the linear parameter on price, which should be
            sufficiently negative. The following behaviors are supported:

                - ``'raise'`` (default) - Raise an exception.

                - ``'warn'`` - Uses the last computed prices and shares. If the fixed point routine fails to converge,
                  these are the last prices and shares computed by the routine. If there are other issues, these are the
                  starting prices and their associated shares.

        processes : `int, optional`
            Number of Python processes that will be used during computation. By default, multiprocessing will not be
            used. For values greater than one, a pool of that many Python processes will be created. Market-by-market
            computation of prices and shares will be distributed among these processes. Using multiprocessing will only
            improve computation speed if gains from parallelization outweigh overhead from creating the process pool.

        Returns
        -------
        `recarray`
            Simulated :attr:`Simulation.product_data` that are updated with Bertrand-Nash prices and shares, which can
            be passed to `product_data` in :class:`Problem`.
