        Free yourself from the tedious operation, now you can just use a one-line command to view the electricity information of your dormitory.
        
        The data comes from the BUPT Work WeChat. But please **notice that** this utility tool can only query the dormitory which is located on Xitucheng Campus. The other campuses are not supported at the moment.
        
        **FEATURES**
        
        * Get your power data easily, including surplus, voltage, current, power, etc.
        * Calculate available time.
        
        Requirements
        -------------
        * Python 3
        
        Quick Start
        ------------
        Step 1: Install from PyPI
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        ::
        
          pip install buptelecmon
        
        Step 2: Set your authorization information
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        This information is used to log in to the query interface. We won't send your information to other sites.
        ::
        
          elecinfo --set-auth
        
        And input your student ID and your password. The password is usually the same as your Information Portal (my.bupt.edu.cn).
        ::
        
          Student ID:
          Password:
        
        Your authorization information will be saved to ``~/.elecmon/elecmon.json``.
        
        Step 3: Run it
        ++++++++++++++++
        ::
        
          elecinfo <dormitory-number>
        
        The *dormitory-number* must be in the correct format (ApartmentNumber-DormitoryNumber, e.g 1-101).
        
        Also, this command tool will remember the dormitory number of the last query. Next time, if you want to query the same dormitory as last query, just type::
        
          elecinfo
        
        Advanced Usage
        ---------------
        Full Command Line
        ++++++++++++++++++
        ::
        
          elecinfo [ --version | --set-auth | [--loop] dormitory-list]
        
        ==============  ======================================================================
         Option         Description
        ==============  ======================================================================
        --version       Display the version of this tool.
        --set-auth      Set your authorization information, as the Quick Start - Step 2 shows.
        --loop          Repeat querying electricity information every 60 seconds.
        dormitory-list  A list of dormitories to be queried, separated by whitespaces.
        ==============  ======================================================================
        
        **Note:** Please DO NOT query too many dormitories at the same time or query too frequently, otherwise you may receive ``HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`` s from the remote server.
        
        APIs
        +++++
        We allow you to use the APIs to build your applications, for example::
        
          import buptelecmon
          em = buptelecmon.electricitymonitor.ElectricityMonitor()
          em.login('student_id', 'password')
          em.query(['x-xxx'])
        
        For more information, please read the `APIs Document`_.
