on_after_scroll(item)

**domain**: server

**language**: python

**class** :doc:`Item class </refs/server/item_api>`

Description
===========

Occurs after an application scrolls from one record to another.

The item parameter is the item that triggered the event.

Write an on_after_scroll event handler to take specific action immediately after 
an application scrolls to another record as a result of a call to 
the :doc:`first <m_first>`, :doc:`last <m_last>`, :doc:`next <m_next>`, 
:doc:`prior <m_prior>`, and :doc:`locate <m_locate>` methods. on_after_scroll is 
called after all other events triggered by these methods and any other methods 
that switch from record to record in the item dataset.
