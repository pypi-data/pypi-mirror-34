### About

Along with the website `netqe-infra01.knqe.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com:8009` this tool was made to view network test data for the Red Hat Network QE team.  It uses matplotlib in order to create the graphs which are present in the output PDF.  Uses website API calls to access and write to the mongodb.

This tool will create two new commands:
* `fileMaker [-o (<output file name>]`
    * -o &nbsp; --output &nbsp; [default: out.txt]
* `graphGen -f <input file name>`

### Installation

This tool requires Python version 3.X

1. First install tkinter on your system
    ```
    $ sudo yum install install (python34-tkinter|python36-tkinter)
    ```

    or

    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```
1. If you are using a virtualenv use the flag `--system-site-packages` so that system wide packages are available to the virtual environment.

1. Finally:
    ```
    $ (pip|pip3) install qeGraphMaker
    ```

### Input text file
The input text for the graph generator is a well structured file as defined in the [example file](/graphMaker/multiGraphFileExample).

### Input file generator
For a user friendly process when creating the input file use the `fileMaker` command.  This will walk you through the process of creating a file that can the be passed into `graphGen`. Use <TAB> to autocomplete options. When inputting cards and labels, at least one option is required; no input is required for flags.

### The graph generator
Once you have a text file that is of the correct form.  You can run `graphGen -f <file-name>`.  This will give you a PDF booklet as defined by the first line of the input file
