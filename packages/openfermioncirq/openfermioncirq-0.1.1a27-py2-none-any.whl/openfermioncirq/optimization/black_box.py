    u"""A black box objective function.

    This class encapsulates the evaluation of an objective function. The
    objective function may be noisy. It is assumed that the objective function
    takes as input an array of real numbers. The dimension of the black box is
    defined to be the length of the input array.

    One can optionally provide a version of the objective function that takes a
    `cost` parameter. This is used to model situations in which the objective
    function is noisy but the amount of noise present can be controlled to some
    extent, i.e., providing a higher cost should reduce the magnitude of the
    noise.

    Attributes:
        dimension: The dimension of the array accepted by the objective
            function.
        bounds: Optional bounds on the inputs to the objective function. This is
            a list of tuples of the form (low, high), where low and high are
            lower and upper bounds on a parameter. The number of tuples
            should be equal to the dimension of the black box.

        Returns a tuple (a, b) such that when `evaluate_with_cost` is called
        with the given cost and returns an approximate function value y, the
        true function value lies in the interval [y + a, y + b]. Thus, it should
        be the case that a <= 0 <= b.

        This function takes an optional `confidence` parameter which is a real
        number strictly between 0 and 1 that gives the confidence level in the
        bound. This is used for situations in which exact bounds on the noise
        cannot be guaranteed. The value can be interpreted as the probability
        that a repeated call to `evaluate_with_cost` with the same cost will
        return a value within the bounds.
