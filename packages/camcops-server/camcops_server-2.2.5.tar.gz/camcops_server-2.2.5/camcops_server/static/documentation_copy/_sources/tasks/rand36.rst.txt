RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey 1.0
-----------------------------------------

History and guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developed at RAND as part of the Medical Outcomes Study.

- Medical Outcomes Study: see
  http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/mos_references.html

- Ware JE & Sherbourne CD (1992): http://www.pubmed.gov/1593914.

- See source below.

Note:

- The RAND 36-Item Health Survey (as here, distributed by RAND) contains the
  same items as the MOS SF-36® (distributed by Medical Outcomes Trust / MOS
  Trust Inc., http://www.outcomes-trust.org/instruments.htm#SF-36), but has a
  slightly different scoring system. See Hays RD et al. (1993),
  http://www.pubmed.gov/8275167.

- A later, commercial version exists, the SF-36v2™; see http://www.sf-36.org/.

- RAND use “SF-36” in the description of their version, but because of the
  trademark
  (http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&p_lang=english&p_d=trmk), we use
  “RAND-36”.
