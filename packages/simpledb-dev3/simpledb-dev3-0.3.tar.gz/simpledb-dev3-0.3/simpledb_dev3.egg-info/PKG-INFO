        This is a fork of [SimpleDB/dev][simpledb-dev] by Matthew Painter via [this unofficial mirror][latortuga]. This fork has been renamed to _simpledb-dev2_ so that it does not collide with the original project.
        
        It currently supports the "2007-11-07" SimpleDB API level but has been hacked to fake support for "2009-04-15"&mdash;this has not been tested much!
        
        ## Project information
        
        simpledb-dev2 provides a local SimpleDB server, so you can develop offline, without requiring a SimpleDB account. It has been tested on Linux, macOS and Windows.
        
        This package currently implements:
        
        * The whole "2007-11-07" REST API
        * Correct HTTP error responses as per the technical documentation
        * A large suite of tests created from the examples provided in the technical documentation
        
        It does not implement:
        
        * The SOAP API
        * Authentication&mdash;signature value checking
        * Timestamp format and expiration checking
        * HTTPS
        
        To run the simpledb-dev2 server, you'll need a working Python 2.7 installation. You can install using [pip][pip] as follows:
        
        ```
        pip install simpledb-dev2
        ```
        
        This will install the package and its dependencies including [web.py][web-py]. Specify the `--user` option to the `pip` command line to install for the current user only.
        
        This will create a `simpledb-dev2` script/executable on your path. You can start the simpledb-dev2 web server as follows:
        
        ```
        simpledb-dev2 serve
        ```
        
        This will serve the SimpleDB API on the default port of 8080. To specify an alternative port, use the `--port` option:
        
        ```
        simpledb-dev2 serve --port 1234
        ```
        
        If the server doesn't start, or you have other problems, it's pretty easy to run the tests and see some examples of request/response:
        
        ```
        simpledb-dev2 test
        ```
        
        Remember, this is a development tool, and not meant for storing or querying large amounts of data&mdash;I do not know yet how big you can get before running into issues, but I suspect that with the current storage and querying design it is not that large :o) Now that I have a base, I may start trying to see how I can improve the performance&hellip;
        
        Although this conforms to the specifications in the technical documentation, simpledb-dev2 has not been tested with every possible SDB client library, and I am looking forward to people in the OSS community trying to find bugs and peculiarities&mdash;it is after all, a work in progress!
        
        _So enjoy developing your SimpleDB applications now, not later!_
