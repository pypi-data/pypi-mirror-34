The `mcmcplot <https://prmiles.wordpress.ncsu.edu/codes/python-packages/mcmcplot/>`_ package is designed to assist in the analysis of sampling chains gathered during a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.  This package was designed with the MCMC code `pymcmcstat <https://prmiles.wordpress.ncsu.edu/codes/python-packages/pymcmcstat/>`_ in mind; however, the plotting routines are amenable to other data sets.  The plotting routines use `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_.  User's are recommended to investigate other plotting routines available in `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_ as it is specifically designed for this sort of analysis.  The routines available in `mcmcplot <https://prmiles.wordpress.ncsu.edu/codes/python-packages/mcmcplot/>`_ serve as a useful wrapper function for several `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_ plots, but it is not an exhaustive demonstration.
