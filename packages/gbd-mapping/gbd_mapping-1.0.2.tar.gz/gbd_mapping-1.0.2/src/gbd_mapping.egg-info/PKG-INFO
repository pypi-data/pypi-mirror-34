        Mapping of GBD entities to their metadata.
        
        There are two packages offered in this distribution.  The first, the ``gbd_mapping_generator``
        is a set of scripts that define templates and data gathering code used to produce the second, the ``gbd_mapping``.
        The ``gbd_mapping_generator`` package will not function without access to the IHME cluster and some of our
        internally used data access libraries.
        
        The ``gbd_mapping`` is a programmatically accessible (and TAB-complete-able) set of mappings for GBD entities
        including:
        
         - Causes
         - Risks
         - Covariates
         - Etiologies
         - Sequelae
        
        There are additional mappings for objects mostly built around custom data.  The primary instance of this is the
        ``coverage_gap`` mapping.  Coverage Gaps are non-GBD entities representing the lack of coverage of interventions
        to particular GBD causes and risks.
        
        You can install ``gbd_mapping`` from PyPI with pip:
        
          ``> pip install gbd_mapping``
        
        or build it from source with
        
          ``> git clone https://github.com/ihmeuw/gbd_mapping.git``
        
          ``> cd gbd_mapping``
        
          ``> python setup.py install``
