Cubane is:

* For visitors to provide a fast and high-quality website experience

* For owners and staff members to provide a very simple and effective way to
  edit content and business data and

* For developers to enable them to deliver the above continuously without
  redeveloping key parts over and over again.

We hope that Cubane can make your life as a developer easier by providing a set
of tested tools to solve common development challenges in various business
domains.

Cubane is written in python and is based on the Django web framework. Cubane
adds additional concepts that will help you to build websites and backend
systems even faster.

Building websites that deliver a great user experience for visitors and content
editors alike - but are also high performant at the same time - is a complex
task; To do it continuously on a deadline is really only possible if you have a
set of tools that get you there.

    language) or Django (the framework), you might want to start by getting an
