        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Simple Python functions for calculating psuedo-spectral acceleration and
        rotated psuedo-spectral acceleration. The response of the
        single-degree-of-freedom oscillator is computed in the frequency domain along
        with frequency-domain interpolation to accurately capture the high-frequency
        characteristics.
        
        The calculation of the response spectrum is performed using frequency domain
        transfer functions, as well as frequency domain interpolation methods to insure
        that the time step of the motions is greater than 10 times the natural
        frequency of the oscillator frequency. Two perpendicular ground motions can be
        rotated to compute the response at various percentiles. For example, the
        minimum, median, and maximum could be computed using percentiles of  0, 50,
        and 100. The orientation of both the minimum and maximum percentile are
        provided, but not orientation is provided for other percentiles because the
        rotate spectral acceleration is not monotonically increasing.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pyrotd`` is available from the Python Cheese Shop::
        
            pip install pyrotd
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Spectral accelerations may be computed for a single time series::
        
            osc_damping = 0.05
            osc_freqs = np.logspace(-1, 2, 91)
            spec_accels = pyrotd.calc_spec_accels(
                time_step, accels, osc_freqs, osc_damping)
        
        Rotated spectral accelerations may be computed for a pair of time series::
        
            rot_osc_resps = pyrotd.calc_rotated_spec_accels(
                time_step, accels_a, accels_b, osc_freqs, osc_damping)
        
        A more detailed example is in `this`_ Jupyter Notebook.
