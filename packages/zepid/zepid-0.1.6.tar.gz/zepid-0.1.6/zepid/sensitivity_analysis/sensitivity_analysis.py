'''Tools for sensitivity analyses. I still need to read Lash & Fox to integrate more tools
for multiple bias analysis. This branch is still very much a work in progress. The goal is 
to simplify sensitivity analyses, in the hopes they become more common in publications

-rr_corr(): generates a corrected RR based on RR of confounder and probabilities confounder
-trapezoidal(): generates a trapezoidal distribution of values
-delta_beta(): conducts a delta-beta (change in estimate) analysis

    when a single observation is excluded from the dataframe for all the observations. This function 
    uses statsmodels to calculate betas. All observations and the difference in estimates is stored 
    in a pandas dataframe that is returned by the function. Multiple delta betas are able to estimated
    at once. All beta(s) of interest should be included in a list. Difference in estimates is calculated 
    by substracting the full model results from the reduced results. Returns dataframe of requested betas

    issues when that observation (or group of observations) was removed from the model.
