Description: pfdicom_tagExtract
        ==================
        
        Quick Overview
        --------------
        
        -  pfdicom_tagExtract generates reports in various formats based on DICOM tags
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        pfdicom_tagExtract extracts the header information of DICOM files and echoes to stdout as well as to an output report-type file -- this can be a raw output, a json-type output, or html-type output.
        
        The script accepts an <inputDir>, and then from this point an os.walk  is performed to extract all the subdirs. Each subdir is examined for DICOM files (in the simplest sense by a file extension mapping) and either the head, tail, middle (or other indexed) file is examined for its tag information.
        
        Optionally, the tag list can be constrained either by passing a <tagFile> containing a line-by-line list of tags to query, or by passing a comma separated list of tags directly.
        
        Finally, an image conversion can also be performed (and embedded within the output html file, if an html conversion is specified).
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        The following dependencies are installed on your host system/python3 virtual env (they will also be automatically installed if pulled from pypi):
        
        -  pfmisc (various misc modules and classes for the pf* family of objects)
        -  pftree (create a dictionary representation of a filesystem hierarchy)
        -  pfidcom (handle underlying DICOM file reading)
        -  matplotlib (handle saving / conversion to image formats for html reports)
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The best method of installing this script and all of its dependencies is
        by fetching it from PyPI
        
        .. code:: bash
        
                pip3 install pfdciom_tagExtract
        
        Command line arguments
        ----------------------
        
        .. code:: html
        
        
                -I|--inputDir <inputDir>
                Input DICOM directory to examine. By default, the first file in this
                directory is examined for its tag information. There is an implicit
                assumption that each <inputDir> contains a single DICOM series.
        
                -i|--inputFile <inputFile>
                An optional <inputFile> specified relative to the <inputDir>. If 
                specified, then do not perform a directory walk, but convert only 
                this file.
        
                -e|--extension <DICOMextension>
                An optional extension to filter the DICOM files of interest from the 
                <inputDir>.
        
                [-O|--outputDir <outputDir>]
                The directory to contain all output files.
        
                -F|--tagFile <JSONtagFile>
                Parse the tags and their "subs" from a JSON formatted <JSONtagFile>.
        
                -T|--tagStruct <JSONtagStructure>
                Parse the tags and their "subs" from a JSON formatted <JSONtagStucture>
                passed directly in the command line.
        
                -o|--outputFileStem <outputFileStem>
                The output file stem to store data. This should *not* have a file
                extension, or rather, any "." in the name are considered part of 
                the stem and are *not* considered extensions.
        
                [--threads <numThreads>]
                If specified, break the innermost analysis loop into <numThreads>
                threads.
        
                [-x|--man]
                Show full help.
        
                [-y|--synopsis]
                Show brief help.
        
                [--json]
                If specified, output a JSON dump of final return.
        
                -v|--verbosity <level>
                Set the app verbosity level. 
        
                     -1: No internal output.
                      0: All internal output.
