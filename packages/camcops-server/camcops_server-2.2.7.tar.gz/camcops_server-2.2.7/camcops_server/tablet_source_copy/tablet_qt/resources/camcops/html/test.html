  <h1>Test HTML page</h1>

  <p>This page has no function except to test the built-in HTML viewer. The
  file is a Qt resource file, meaning that it is hidden from the filesystem
  (and typically baked into the executable). Consequently, HTML processing is
  limited, and as of 2018-06-03 we have moved primarily to online
  documentation, which can be considerably better.</p>
