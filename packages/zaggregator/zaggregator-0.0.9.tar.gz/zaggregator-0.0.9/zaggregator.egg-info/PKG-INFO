Description: 
        # Zaggregator
        
        Zaggregator - is a non-envasive per-process data collector for Zabbix.
        
        It consists of two parts:
         - zaggregator (daemon) which fetches and caches process table each zaggregator.daemon.delay (30) seconds, groups processes and stores statistics into sqlite database.
         - zcheck script for integrating with zabbix-agent fetches data from sqlite database
        
        There is systemd service file for zaggregator-daemon, but for security reasons pip cannot install files into /etc, so you will need to do it manually. See [Install](#install) section for details.
