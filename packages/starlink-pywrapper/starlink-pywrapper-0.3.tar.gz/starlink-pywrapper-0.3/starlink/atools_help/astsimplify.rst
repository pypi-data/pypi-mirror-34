ASTSIMPLIFY
===========


Purpose
~~~~~~~
Simplify a Mapping


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This application simplifies a Mapping (which may be a compound Mapping
such as a CmpMap) to eliminate redundant computational steps, or to
merge separate steps which can be performed more efficiently in a
single operation.


Usage
~~~~~


::

    
       astsimplify this result
       



ADAM parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



FMT = LITERAL (Read)
````````````````````
The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
"STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used if the
output object is written to a text file. An error is reported if the
output object cannot be written using the requested format. ["AST"]



RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
```````````````````````
An text file to receive the simplified Mapping.



THIS = LITERAL (Read)
`````````````````````
An NDF or text file holding the Mapping. If an NDF is supplied, the
Mapping from the base Frame of the WCS FrameSet to the current Frame
will be used.
