Description: # Interactive Judger for Python3
        This project was initially being used to help me with the Python course I taught at Algorithm 101, CSE. I modified it to a more friendly version during my spare time.

        ### Step 2
        Save your test cases(parameters for method being tested) in a file and place it into `data` folder. Copy python files you want to test into `src` folder, and finally, copy your answers(corresponding with the test case) into a file and move it into `data` folder.
