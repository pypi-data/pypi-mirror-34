# mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin

*A MkDocs plugin that injects the mkdocs.yml extra variables into the markdown template*

**usecase**

```
As a user with variables that need to be inserted at the markdown level, not the template level.
I need a mkdocs plugin that will inject my `extras` variables into the markdown template before it gets rendered to html.
So that I can build my markdown pages with different values for images, urls, client_names, etc. 
```

## Installation

> **Note:** This package requires MkDocs version 0.17 or higher. 

Install the package with pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-markdownextradata-plugin
```

Enable the plugin in your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
    - search
    - markdownextradata
```

> **Note:** If you have no `plugins` entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also want to add the `search` plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no `plugins` entry set, but now you have to enable it explicitly.

More information about plugins in the [MkDocs documentation][mkdocs-plugins]

## Features

### Use Extra Variables in your markdown files

The variables you define in the mkdown.yml `extra:` slot will become available in your templates

```yaml
extra:
  customer:
    name: Your name here
    web: www.example.com
    salt: salt.example.com
```

and then in your `*.md` files

```jinja
{{ customer.name }}
<a href="{{ customer.web }}">{{ customer.web }}</a>
```
