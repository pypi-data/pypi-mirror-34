        pyinfra manages the state of one or more servers. It can be used for
        app/service deployment, config management and ad-hoc command execution.
        Deploys are asynchronous, highly performant and can target thousands of
        hosts in parallel. The inventory of servers and deploy state are written
        in Python, allowing for near-infinite extendability. pyinfra is
        available via the command line and as a Python API.

        Design Features
        ---------------
        
        pyinfra was designed to enable us to deploy things in a consistent,
        debuggable and maintainable manner. Notable design decisions:
        
        -  properly agentless - even Python isn’t required on the remote side
           (just a shell!)
        -  always print raw stderr on operation failure for *instant* debugging
        -  ``-v`` means print out remote stdout & stderr in realtime
        -  outputs shell commands and files to upload
        -  two-step deploy that enables dry-runs
        -  fail fast where possible (eg touching a directory)
        -  uses pure, 100% Python for the inventory and deploy scripts
        
           -  with operations/hooks to safely use Python mid-deploy
