  <description>Hierarchical Data System Version 4</description>
  <abstract>
    <p>HDS is a file-based hierarchical data system designed for the
      storage of a wide variety of information. It is particularly
      suited to the storage of large multi-dimensional arrays (with
      their ancillary data) where efficient access is needed.</p>
    <p>HDS organises data into hierarchies, broadly similar to the
      directory structure of a hierarchical filing system, but
      contained within a single HDS container file.  The
      structures stored in these files are self-describing and
      flexible; HDS supports modification and extension of structures
      previously created, as well as deletion, copying, renaming, etc..</p>
    <p>All information stored in HDS files is portable between the
      machines on which HDS is implemented. Thus, there are no format
      conversion problems when moving between machines.</p>
    <p>The routines in this package may be used to perform operations
      on any HDS data. In addition, HDS forms a toolkit for the
      construction of higher level (more specialised) data structures
      and the software which accesses them.  HDS routines are
      therefore invoked indirectly by many other items of Starlink
      software.</p>
    <p>This library handles HDS files version 4 and below.</p>
