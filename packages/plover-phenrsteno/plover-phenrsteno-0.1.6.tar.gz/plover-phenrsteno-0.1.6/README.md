# Usage

Once installed, you have two options:

  - Use someone elseâ€™s dictionaries
  - Create your own

You can [download my dictionaries from this repository](./json). `verbatim.json` is for fingerspelling individual letters. `vocabulary.json`, `prefixes.json`, and `suffixes.json` are for transcribing (British) English words.

# Development

To-do:

  - \[x\] Move explanations to the wiki
  - \[x\] Write installation instructions in README.md
  - \[x\] Use unicode IPA symbols for stroke notation
      - \[ \] If that works, convert my dictionaries to this new format
  - \[ \] Implement prefix keys
      - \[ \] Integrate with [prefix support](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/issues/974)
      - \[ \] Or use a Python dictionary as a workaround
