Copyright

- Somewhat unclear.

- Torralva (2009, corrected 2010) article contains scale text. That article is
  marked copyright © 2009 INS (International Neuropsychological Society).

- However, that article was then corrected for copyright reasons, as it
  contained (in its Appendix) material from the Wechsler Memory Scale –
  Revised, for which the copyright is owned by NCS Pearson Inc.; that part was
  removed in the corrected version.

- The removed text was the instructions for the “digits backward” task.

- For the moment, only a skeleton task (with no task text) is included in
  CamCOPS.
