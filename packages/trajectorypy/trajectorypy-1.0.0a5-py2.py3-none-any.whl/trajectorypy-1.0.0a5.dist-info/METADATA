trajectorypy - Trajectory Tracking Library
==========================================

trajectorypy is a library to track a phase state object that leaves a trajectory.

A trajectory here means the following according to Wikipedia.

    The system's evolving state over time traces a path 
    (a phase space trajectory for the system) through the high-dimensional space. 
    The phase space trajectory represents the set of states 
    compatible with starting from one particular initial condition, 
    located in the full phase space that represents the set of states compatible with starting from any initial condition.

Installation
============

$ pip install trajectorypy
