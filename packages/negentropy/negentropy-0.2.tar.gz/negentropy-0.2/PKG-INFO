Description: # negentropy
        
        Negentropy is a disassembler for the C64 that I'm working on written in Python. It's my first real Python program and is still a work in progress, but nevertheless it's quite useful. Here's a list of some of the features currently implemented:
        * Generate HTML pages, complete with images and links.
        * Disassemble 6502 machine code.
        * List BASIC programs.
        * Annotate the generated output with labels and comments provided in configuration files.
        * Generate images for character sets.
        * Links, including in BASIC programs, machine code programs and even from SYS commands in BASIC to the target code.
        
        In addition to Python's standard library the following packages are used:
        * *Jinja2* - used for templates. Currently only HTML is supported (there are other incomplete templates). Checkout its website [here](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
        * *Pillow* - for image generation. It's [website](https://python-pillow.org/)
        * *Lark* - for parsing. It's LALR parser is bloody fast (and its author tolerant of stupid questionsðŸ˜Š). It's [website](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark)
