==================
Content Management
==================

The content management aspect of Cubane is based around a separate app and the
ability to derive your own model instances that are representing editable
content.

The CMS system provides different ways of representing editable content
alongside website-wide settings.

The system can also be used in combination with other aspects of Cubane, for
example the shop system.
