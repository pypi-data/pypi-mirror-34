===========================
Create a new Cubane Project
===========================

This tutorial guides you through the creation of a new website. As we
follow the tutorial along, we will step by step incorporate new structural
elements and features into the website.

Let's start by choosing a project. Feel free to pick a theme by yourself; for
the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that we are tasked to build a new
website for, let's say **The history of programming languages**.

To create a new project, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cubane --create example example.com bugs@example.com

Our site shall *list* commonly used programming languages, will inform its
visitors about the history of each language and will also offer a number of
books for each language.

We'll assume you have :ref:`cubane installed <tutorials/install>` already. You can
tell if Cubane is installed and which version by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cubane --version

If cubane is installed, you should see the version of your installation.

.. note::

    If you get an error that the command ``cubane`` could not be found, then
    cubane might not be installed.

    You may also need to add the cubane bin folder to your system path in
    order for your shell to find the ``cubane`` command.
