Any file named 'DESCRIPTION.txt' in the top folder, stored alongside the Dockerfile itself, will be used as a default description for the program when it is uploaded with collabtools.


This folder contains the basics necessary to create a working program for Collab that can be uploaded with collabtools.


The Dockerfile is the most important file. Read the Docker documentation to find out how it works.
The requirements.txt file lists 'collab' as the only requirement of this example. This is a pip-installable library to help you interface with other programs in Collab.
The file app.py contains the meat of the example. It defines a program that is designed to call itself again in such a way that each execution will create the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
