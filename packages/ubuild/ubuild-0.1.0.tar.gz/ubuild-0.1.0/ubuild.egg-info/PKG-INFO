        Introduction
        ============
        
        This project provides a Python 3.3+ library/utility for creating build
        scripts. The main features of Ubuild are:
        
        -  Streamlines the discoverability of build steps/tasks.
        
        -  Build step/task details are captured in Python functions.
        
        -  Provides a CLI menu to show available build steps/tasks.
        
        -  Provides a CLI utility ``ubuild`` to locate and run build scripts.
