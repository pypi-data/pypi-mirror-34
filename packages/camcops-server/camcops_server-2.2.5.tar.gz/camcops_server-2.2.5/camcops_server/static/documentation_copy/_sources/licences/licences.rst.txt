..
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation
        or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled
        object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
..
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form,
        made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that
        is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the
        Appendix below).
..
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
        that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
        revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as
        a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
        Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
        merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
        Works thereof.
..
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
        version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
        Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for

        Contribution."
..
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on

..
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
        hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
        royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
        Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
        distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
..
        3. Grant of Patent License.
..
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
        hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
        royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
        to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
        transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
        licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
        Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
        litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
        lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
        Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
        patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
        terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
..
        4. Redistribution.
..
        You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
        thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
        Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
..
        You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
        of this License; and You must cause any modified files to carry prominent
        notices stating that You changed the files; and You must retain, in the
        Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
        patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the
        Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works; and If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of
        its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
        NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
        Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
        text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source
        form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
        third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
        for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add
        Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
        alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
        such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the
        License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
        reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
        Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
        distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
        this License.
..
        5. Submission of Contributions.
..
        Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
        submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
        the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
        conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
        modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
..
        6. Trademarks.
..
        This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
        service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
        reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
        reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
..
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
..
        Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
        provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an
        "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
        or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
        TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
        using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
        exercise of permissions under this License.
..
        8. Limitation of Liability.
..
        In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
        negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
        (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
        shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
        indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
        arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
        the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
        stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
        damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
        possibility of such damages.
..
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
..
        While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
        to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
        However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
        and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
        and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
        harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
        Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
        liability.

FloatingPoint

The CamCOPS client uses Google's FloatingPoint class for “nearly equal”
testing. This is from the Google C++ Testing Framework.

Images

For images relating to specific tasks, see each task’s information file. For
the CamCOPS general images:

..  Something about URLs makes Sphinx go wrong with e.g.
    WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
    The practical answer seems to be to stop word-wrapping the lines in the
    table that complain.
..  More generally, sometimes URLs with underscores in generate errors about
    "bad target name" or similar. Try replacing http://dodgy_url with
    `<http://dodgy_url>`_
