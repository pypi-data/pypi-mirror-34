Description: catscan, or mindgrep
        =======
        
        Forgot where you put that file? Forgot what you were working on?
        
        Wish you could grep against a file you forgot about?
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From the project root directory::
        
            $ pip install catscan
        
        or::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Simply run it with something that might be in the file, and it will check through files you worked with in your bash history::
        
            # Find files you worked on that have the search string 'install' in them.
            $ catscan 'install'
            /home/johannestaas/dev/catscan/catscan/install.py
            /home/johannestaas/dev/catscan/setup.py
            /home/johannestaas/dev/catscan/README.rst
            /home/johannestaas/dev/catscan/catscan/install.py
            /home/johannestaas/dev/mkpip/setup.py
        
        Use --help/-h to view info on the arguments::
        
            $ catscan --help
        
        More complex scan behavior is also available::
        
            # search using regex (python format)
            $ catscan -r '201[56]-\d+-\d+'
        
            # limit to files less than 1 megabyte
            $ catscan -m 1 'foo'
        
            # limit to files less than ~100 kilobytes 
            $ catscan -m 0.1 'foo'
        
            # case insensitive search
            $ catscan -i 'foo'
        
            # Look for files that are not necessarily ASCII (using file magic)
            $ catscan -a 'CAFEBABE'
        
            # Quit after finding the first matching file
            $ catscan -q 1 'foo'
