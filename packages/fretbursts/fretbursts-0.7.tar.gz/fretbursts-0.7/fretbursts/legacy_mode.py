"""
Load this module as::

    from legacy_names import *

to load a bunch of names once available when loading FRETBursts. This module
is provided as a compatibility layer to be used to run old scripts or notebooks.

Please don't import this module on new code.

**Long rationale explanation**

On April 2014 FRETBursts project structure has changed in order to become a
conventional python package. During this refactoring the default way to load
FRETBursts changed from::

    run fretbursts.py

to::

    from fretbursts import *

The latter imports the submodules and packages as before, but it only imports
a restricted number of core object names (i.e. Data(), dplot(), see
__init__.py for details).
The old behaviour was loading a big chunk of matplotlib.pyplot and
a lot of functions from burstlib.

Now the preferred way is to use always `plt.` to access the matplotlib.pyplot
functions and `bl.` to access any function in `burstlib`. This change makes
maintenance, unit testing and installation easier.

This module provides "most" of the old object names now removed as a way to run
old code with minimal effort. Please do not use this in new code.
