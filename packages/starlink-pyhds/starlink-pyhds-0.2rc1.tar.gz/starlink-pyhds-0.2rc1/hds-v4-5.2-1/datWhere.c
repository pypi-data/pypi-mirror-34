/*
*+
*  Name:
*     DAT_WHERE

*  Purpose:
*     Find position of primitive in HDS file.

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DAT_WHERE( LOC, BLOCK, OFFSET, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine returns information describing the position in an HDS
*     container file at which the data associated with a primitive
*     object are stored.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Primitive object locator.
*     BLOCK = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Number of the file block in which the object's data start. HDS
*        file blocks are 512 bytes long and are numbered from the
*        beginning of the file, starting at block 1.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Byte offset (zero based) of the start of data within the file
*        block.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The use of this routine is not recommended. It is provided
*     solely for use by experienced programmers who are familiar with
*     the internal structure of HDS container files and who wish to
*     access the file contents directly. Note, however, that changes to
*     the format of an HDS file may occur in future.
*     -  The start of the data associated with a cell or a slice of a
*     primitive object may be located with this routine, but the data
*     associated with a slice will not, in general, be stored at
*     contiguous locations within the file.
*     -  Care must be taken that no changes are made to adjacent bytes
*     within the file which are not part of the requested object's
*     data.
*     -  Note that the data associated with primitive objects may not
*     necessarily be stored contiguously in future versions of HDS.

*  History:

*        Original version.
*     13-AUG-1991 (RFWS):
*        Added prologue and tidied. Made portable.
