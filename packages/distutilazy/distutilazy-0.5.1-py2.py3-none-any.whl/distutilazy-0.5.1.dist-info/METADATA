Extra distutils commands, including:

* clean_pyc: clean compiled python files
* clean_jython_class: clean compiled .class files created by Jython
* clean_all: using ``distutils.clean``, ``clean_pyc`` and ``clean_jython_class`` to clean all temporary files
* bdist_pyinstaller: convenient calls for `PyInstaller <http://www.pyinstaller.org>`_ with sane defaults
* test: run unit tests

An entry point script is also provided to call commands directly, currently only
the clean commands are exposed via the script.

Installation
------------
Use ``pip`` to install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install distutilazy

To install from the source, download the source and run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install

There are no specific dependencies, distutilazy runs on Python 2.7+
(CPython 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, PyPy 2.6 and PyPy3.5 are tested).
Tests pass on Jython so it should be fine for Jython as well.


How
---
After installing distutilazy, add ``distutilazy.command`` package to the list
of command packages in your ``setup.cfg`` file.

.. code-block:: ini

    [global]
    command_packages = distutilazy.command

That's it. Now you may use new commands directly from your ``setup.py``.

To clean compiled python files:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py clean_pyc

To clean all temporary files (build artifacts, compiled files created by CPython or Jython, etc.):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py clean_all


Available commands are in ``distutilazy.command`` package, each command as a separate module.

To use custom command names for the same functionality, use command classes defined in distutilazy modules
(each module might define more than a single command class).

The modules should be imported in `setup.py`, then desired classes might be assigned to command names
using the ``cmdclass`` parameter.

.. code-block::

    import distutilazy.clean

    setup(
        cmdclass: {
            'clean_pyc': distutilazy.clean.CleanPyc,
            'clean_jython': distutilazy.clean.CleanJythonClass,
            'clear': distutilazy.clean.CleanAll
        }
    )

To extend (or customize) the behavior of the command classes define a class extending from these command classes,
and use that custom class in ``cmdclass``.

Entry Point Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `distutilazy` script provides a direct access to the commands. call it with
`-h` or `--help` to see available commands. For example this command runs
the `clean_all` command (provided by distutilazy package) directly, even
without a `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`.


.. code-block:: bash

    $ distutilazy clean_all


Development
-----------
* Code is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/farzadghanei/distutilazy>`_.
* Documentations are on `Read The Docs <https://distutilazy.readthedocs.org>`_.


Tests
^^^^^
If you have make available

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

You can always use ``setup.py`` to run tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test
