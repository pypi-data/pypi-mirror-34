title: Complex number value.
description: |
  Represents a complex number matching the following EBNF grammar

  ```
    plus-or-minus = "+" | "-"
    suffix        = "J" | "j" | "I" | "i"
    complex       = [ieee754] [plus-or-minus ieee754 suffix]
  ```

  Where `ieee754` is a floating point number in IEEE 754 decimal
  format.

  Though `J`, `j`, `I` and `i` must be supported on reading, it is
  recommended to use `i` on writing.

examples:
  -
    - 1 real, -1 imaginary
    - "!core/complex-1.0.0 1-1j"
  -
    - 0 real, 1 imaginary
    - "!core/complex-1.0.0 1J"
  -
    - -1 real, 0 imaginary
    - "!core/complex-1.0.0 -1"
