Notice
======

This project is in maintenance mode. Please consider using the new tailon_,
which is currently under slow, but steady development. The new version comes
with the following improvements:

* Fully self-contained executables. Just download (or build) and run.
* Tiny footprint - the tailon executable sits at 2.5MB in size and uses roughly 10MB of RSS.
* More responsive user-interface.

While some features are missing, it is already usable to a large degree.

Tailon
======

Tailon is a self-hosted web application for looking at and searching
through log files. It is little more than a fancy web wrapper around
the following commands::

    tail -f
    tail -f | grep
    tail -f | awk
    tail -f | sed
