  usage: qpmg [-h] [-x X [X ...]] [-y Y [Y ...]] [--xlabel XLABEL [XLABEL ...]]
              [--ylabel YLABEL [YLABEL ...]] [--legend LEGEND [LEGEND ...]]
              [--style STYLE] [--title TITLE [TITLE ...]]

``qpmg`` is a simple Python script to quickly inspect output that adheres to the
format used by MESA's profiles and histories and GYRE's summaries and mode
files. While ``qpmg`` provides many options, it's intended for quick inspection
rather than publication-quality plots. To see the list of available columns in
a file, run ``qpmg`` on a given file. The defaults will cause an error that
displays the available columns.

positional arguments: ``filenames``

optional arguments:

-h, --help              show this help message and exit
-x X, -y Y              Column(s) to use for the x and y variables. The code
                        loops through however many x and y keys you give
                        (inner loop over x, outer loop over y) but most of the
                        time you probably only want one x variable.
--xlabel XLABEL, --ylabel YLABEL    Overrides the axis label with the given string.
                        Accepts spaces. i.e. 'effective temperature' is OK.
                        Default is to use the first argument of -x/-y.
--legend LABELS         If 'auto', add a legend using the filenames as keys.
                        Otherwise, use the arguments as a list of keys.
                        Default is no legend.
--style STYLE           .
--title TITLE           Adds the given title to the plot. Accepts spaces. i.e.
                        'my plot' is OK. Default is no title.
--style-file STYLE_FILE         Specifies a matplotlib style file to load.
