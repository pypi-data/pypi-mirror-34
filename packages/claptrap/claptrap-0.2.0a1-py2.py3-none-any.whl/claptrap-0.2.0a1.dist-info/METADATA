Generate random phrases using bigram frequencies. Counts some punctuation as objects when creating bigrams so it includes realistic punctuation.

His where to the snow, but we destroyed them both hands all my
Eyes closed behind us so thankful to two atmospheres, with the
Driver with dust had better not. The hand; instantly formed round
