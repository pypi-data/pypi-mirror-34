install:
  - |
    %PYTHON%\python.exe -m pip install -U pip
    %PYTHON%\python.exe -m pip install wheel tox virtualenv

# note:
# %PYTHON% has: python.exe
# %PYTHON%\Scripts has: pip.exe, tox.exe (and others installed by bare pip)


build: off

# we run from C:\projects\tahoe-lafs

test_script:
  # Put your test command here.
  # Note that you must use the environment variable %PYTHON% to refer to
  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python evrsion you want to use on PATH.
  - |
    %PYTHON%\Scripts\tox.exe -e py

after_test:
  # This builds the main tahoe wheel, and wheels for all dependencies.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
  # interpreter. If _trial_temp still exists, the "pip wheel" fails on
  # _trial_temp\local_dir (not sure why).
  - |
    copy _trial_temp\test.log trial_test_log.txt
    rd /s /q _trial_temp
    %PYTHON%\python.exe setup.py bdist_wheel
    %PYTHON%\python.exe -m pip wheel -w dist .

artifacts:
  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory
  # "pip wheel -w dist ." puts all the dependency wheels there too
  # this gives us a zipfile with everything
  - path: 'dist\*'
  - path: trial_test_log.txt
    name: Trial test.log

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
