        # High card of Queen with Ten, Seven, Six and Four
        [1, 12, 10, 7, 6, 4]
        
        # One pair of Nine with King, Eight and Five
        [2, 9, 13, 8, 5]
        
        # Two pairs of Jakes and Three with Nine
        [3, 11, 3, 9]
        
        # Three of a kind of Deuce with Ace and Ten
        [4, 2, 14, 10]
        
        # Straight of Six, Five, Four, Three and Two
        [5, 6]
        
        # Flush of Ten, Nine, Six, Four and Two
        [6, 10, 9, 6, 4, 2]
        
        # Full house of Three and Six
        [7, 3, 6]
        
        # Four of a kind of Seven with Queen
        [8, 7, 12]
        
        # StraightFlush of Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven and Six
        [9, 10]
        ```
        
        ### Find pure combination
        
        ```python
        from cthpoker import findCombo
        
        cards = [144, 134, 124, 114, 104] # Aв™  Kв™  Qв™  Jв™  Tв™ 
        combo = findCombo(cards)
        print(combo)
        # [9, 14]
        ```
        
        ### Ratio
        
        Ratio shows whether player hand cards in combination base cards or not.
        
        There is three ratio kind: `0` - nominal combination (player hand cards not in combination base cards), `1` - half nominal combination (player hand cards in part of combination base cards, possible in Full house and Two pairs only), `2` - real combination (player hand cards in combination base cards).
        
        #### High card

        ```python
        from cthpoker import findRatioCombo
        
        # In hand card is card increased by 1000
        
        cards = [144, 1114, 84, 72, 54, 1031, 24] # Aв™  Jв™  8в™  7в™¦ 5в™  3в™Ј 2в™ 
        # table cards Aв™  8в™  7в™¦ 5в™  2в™ 
        # hand cards Jв™  3в™Ј
        combo, ratio = findRatioCombo(cards)
        print(combo)
        # [6, 14, 11, 8, 5, 2]
        print(ratio)
        # 2
        
        cards = [103, 102, 104, 1131, 133, 83, 1041] # Tв™Ґ Tв™¦ Tв™  Kв™Ј Kв™Ґ 8в™Ґ 4в™Ј
        # table cards Tв™Ґ Tв™¦ Tв™  Kв™Ґ 8в™Ґ
        # hand cards Kв™Ј 4в™Ј
        combo, ratio = findRatioCombo(cards)
        print(combo)
        # [7, 10, 13]
        print(ratio)
        # 1
        
        cards = [52, 54, 51, 124, 101, 1062, 1023] # 5в™¦ 5в™  5в™Ј Qв™  Tв™Ј 6в™¦ 2в™Ґ
        # table cards 5в™¦ 5в™  5в™Ј Qв™  Tв™Ј
        # hand cards 6в™¦ 2в™Ґ
        combo, ratio = findRatioCombo(cards)
        print(combo)
        # [4, 5, 12, 10]
        print(ratio)
        # 0
