## ANIMAL CUTIES
This is a quick lil script that prints ascii animals in your terminal when you feel like you just sort of need that extra loving support!

To install, just write `pip install animal-cuties` in your terminal.
To run the script, enter `animal-cuties cat` or `animal-cuties dog` etc. depending on what ascii animal you want!
