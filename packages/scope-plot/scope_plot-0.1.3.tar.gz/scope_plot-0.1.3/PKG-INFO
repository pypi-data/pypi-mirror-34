        ## Getting Started with ScopePlot
        
        ScopePlot is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scope-plot/) can be installed with `pip`
        
            $ python -m pip install scope_plot
        
        To install the latest development version from [Github](https://github.com/rai-project/scope_plot)
        
            $ python -m pip install git+git://github.com/rai-project/scope_plot.git
        
        If your current Python installation doesn't have pip available, try [get-pip.py](bootstrap.pypa.io)
        
        After installing ScopePlot you can use it like any other Python module.
        Here's a very simple example:
        
        ```bash
        $ python -m scope_plot bar data.json
        ```
        
        There are multiple subcommands available
        
        ```
        $ python -m scope_plot --help

        Options:
          --debug / --no-debug  print debug messages to stderr.
          --include DIRECTORY   Search location for input_file in spec.
          --help                Show this message and exit.
        
        Commands:
          bar   Create a bar graph from BENCHMARK and write...
          deps  Create a Makefile dependence
