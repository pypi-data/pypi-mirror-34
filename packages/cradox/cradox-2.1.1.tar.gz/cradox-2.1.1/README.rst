/!\ DON'T USE IT, but use upstream python-rados, except you really can't /!\

Python libraries for the Ceph librados library with use cython instead of ctypes

This a standalone library initially comes from this Ceph PR https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/7621

But can be built against older version of Ceph from 10.2.X (jewel) to latest.

(For older version use cradox< 2.0)

This is designed for application that want to use a recent python-rados API without upgrading
the whole ceph cluster.

Rados C handles provided by this library can't be used with the ceph rbd.py or librbdpy.

The API of this python lib will be keep in sync with the upstream Ceph rados.py API.
