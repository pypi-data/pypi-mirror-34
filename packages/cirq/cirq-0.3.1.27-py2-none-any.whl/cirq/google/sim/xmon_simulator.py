u"""XmonSimulator for the Google's Xmon class quantum computers.

The simulator can be used to run all of a Circuit or to step through the
simulation Moment by Moment. The simulator requires that all gates used in
the circuit are either an XmonGate or are CompositionOperations or have a
KnownMatrix which can be decomposed into XmonGates. Measurement gates must all
have unique string keys.

A simple example:
    circuit = Circuit([Moment([X(q1), X(q2)]), Moment([CZ(q1, q2)])])
    sim = XmonSimulator()
    results = sim.run(circuit)

Note that there are two types of methods for the simulator.  "Run" methods
mimic what the quantum hardware provides, and, for example, do not give
access to the wave function.  "Simulate" methods give access to the wave
function, i.e. one can retrieve the final wave function from the simulation
via.
    final_state = sim.simulate(circuit).final_state

    u"""Iterator over XmonStepResult from Moments of a Circuit.

    This should rarely be instantiated directly, instead prefer to create an
    XmonSimulator and use methods on that object to get an iterator.

    Args:
        circuit: The circuit to simulate. Must contain only xmon gates with no
            unresolved parameters.
        options: XmonOptions configuring the simulation.
        qubit_order: Determines the canonical ordering of the qubits used to
            define the order of amplitudes in the wave function.
        initial_state: If this is an int, the state is set to the computational
            basis state corresponding to the integer. Note that
            the low bit of the integer corresponds to the value of the first
            qubit as determined by the basis argument.

            If this is a np.ndarray it is the full initial state.
            In this case it must be the correct size, be normalized (an L2
            norm of 1), and be safely castable to a np.complex64.
        perform_measurements: Whether or not to perform the measurements in
            the circuit. Should only be set to False when optimizing for
            sampling over the measurements.

    Yields:
        XmonStepResults from simulating a Moment of the Circuit.

    Raises:
        TypeError: if the circuit contains gates that are not XmonGates or
            composite gates made of XmonGates.
