# Pedal

A collection of tools to analyze student's Python source code

# TIFA

Tifa is a Type Inferencer and Flow Analyzer. Its goal is not to be a general purpose tool for doing so, but to be focused on simplistic code written in pedagogical settings. This means that it can make a lot of assumptions and forbid a lot of features. Further, it's primary job is not just to collect type information, but to detect issues in the code (e.g., a variable changes type, a variable is not read, a variable is defined in one scope then used in another).

# CAIT
Capturer for AST Inclusion Trees. Its goal is to take a a desired AST and a target AST. CAIT captures trees in the target ast that include the desired AST.

# Feedback

Given the results of execution and analysis, this tool determines what kind of feedback to deliver to the student.

# Mistakes

# Sandbox

# Environments

# Report
