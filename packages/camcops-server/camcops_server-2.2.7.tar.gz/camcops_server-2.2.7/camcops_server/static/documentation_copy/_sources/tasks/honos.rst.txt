- Personal communication from Mick James (HoNOS Advisor, Royal College of
  Psychiatrists) to Rudolf Cardinal, 2012-09-21: “The original R&D was funded
  by the Department of Health and the status of the tool at first publication
  was indeed that it was Crown Copyright. A few years ago we were in discussion
  with the Australian Dept of Health and Ageing and New Zealand Health Ministry
  with the English Department of Health about the development of national
  initiatives mandating HoNOS and the Crown Copyright status was causing some
  legal difficulties so the DH suggested and organised that the copyright be
  legally transferred to the Royal College of Psychiatrists... So, current
  conditions are that copyright is now firmly with the College.”

- Permission to use the HoNOS scales in the current electronic test kit
  (open-source, for clinical and research purposes, without commercial
  marketing) granted by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2012-09-21

  - “Given the arrangements that you describe below for this we would be more
    than happy to grant permissions. Just needs to cite the RCPsych copyright
    and that will be fine.” (personal communication, Mick James [RCPsych] to
    Rudolf Cardinal, 2012-09-21)

    - “I'd hoped to include the HoNOS (with its descriptors) in an open-source
      tablet app for use within our NHS (= CPFT) and research (= University of
      Cambridge) environments -- and, being open-source, potentially for others
      in similar settings. We would not be marketing it commercially in any
      way. Would it therefore be OK to include the HoNOS, citing RCPsych
      copyright and that we were including it with your permission?” (personal
      communication, Rudolf Cardinal to Mick James, 2012-09-21)
