Description: Adobe Reader had a great feature where you can simply fill in text
        into a PDF (not only in forms but simply by putting it over the PDF)
        and then sign it (not cryptographically, but by adding an image with 
        your signature).
        
        This is exactly what is needed to produce filled and signed PDFs without 
        having to print them. Great for a paperless office.
        
        As Adobe Reader is not available anymore for Linux, this little tool hopefully can replace it.
        
        The idea is that it will not do anything besides this one task: 
        
        **Fill in arbitrary text and a signature.**
        
        Currently this is a very early prototype, merely a proof-of-concept. fspdf creates an image from all overlay elements (texts and signatures) and turns it into an PDF. This is then stamped on the original PDF using pdftk's multi-stamp feature. If you are interested in joining the project, get in contact. 
        
        Otherwise just wait until this thing works. The good thing is that I will be motivated to continue whenever a sucking PDF file to be filled and signed hits my inbox. I can assure you, this will happen :-)
        
        PS: Actually, fspdf works for me very well for several months now. Follow the project on GitHub if you are interested in current issues and developments.
