`Continuous Integration <https://travis-ci.org/Hopwork/mongo-connector-postgresql>`_ - `Code Coverage <https://coveralls.io/github/Hopwork/mongo-connector-postgresql>`_

mongo-connector-postgresql is used to make the bridge between PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
It acts as a river from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.

This connector is a plugin for `Mongo Connector <https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector/wiki>`__.
Thanks a lot for their contribution !

System Overview
---------------

`mongo-connector-postgresql` creates a pipeline from a MongoDB cluster to PostgreSQL. It synchronizes data in MongoDB
to the target then tails the MongoDB oplog, keeping up with operations in MongoDB in real-time. It has been tested with
Python 2.7 and PostgreSQL 9.5.

All the works of tailing the oplog, performing the initial sync is made by the `mongo-connector
<https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector/wiki>`__. So the first documentation you should read is on their website.

Getting Started
---------------

For some context (in french) : `See our blog article <https://inside.hopwork.com/business-intelligence-mongodb/>`_

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to install mongo-connector and our extension is with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mongo-connector mongo-connector-postgresql

Using this connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the configuration of the connector, please check out the
`mongo-connector documentation <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector/wiki>`_ beforehand since only the
``pg-mongo-connector`` specifics are written here.

Just call the mongo-connector and specify this plugin with the option ``-d``:

.. code-block:: bash

  mongo-connector  -t postgresql://localhost -d postgresql_manager -c config.json

The url could follow any of the syntax defined by `libpq connection string <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING>`__.

This connector use its own mapping file to determine the fields that should be written in PostgreSQL and their types.
This file should be named mappings.json. Here is a sample :

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "my_mongo_database":{
            "my_mongo_collection":{
                "pk":"id",
                "indices":[
                    "UNIQUE INDEX subproperty_idx ON my_postgre_table(subproperty)"
                ],
                "_id":{
                    "dest":"id",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "description":{
                    "type":"TEXT",
                    "index": true,
                },
                "enable":{
                    "dest":"enabled",
                    "type":"BOOLEAN"
                },
                "myobject.subproperty":{
                    "dest":"subproperty",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "propertyWhichMayBeNull": {
                    "dest":"property_has_been_provided",
                    "type":"_PRESENCE"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Please notice the following :

- The ``pk`` field is mandatory and should point to the destination's primary key
- By default, the ``dest`` field is set to the original Mongo field name.
- If the original document in mongodb has a embedded document, everything is flattened to be inserted in PostgreSQL
- One can define indices in two different ways : Using the array ``indices`` and a SQL definition or autogenerate index
 by setting the ``index`` field to true

The connector also supports arrays of documents. Let say your Mongo database stores the following documents :

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "posts":{
            "name":"Check out the mongo -> postgres connector",
            "content":"Inspiring blog post",
            "comments":[
                {
                    "user":"Elon Musk",
                    "comment":"What a revolution !"
                },
                {
                    "user":"Kevin P. Ryan",
                    "comment":"Nice !"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

To allow the connector to map the post objects AND its comments, you should use the following mapping :

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "my_mongo_database":{
            "posts":{
                "pk":"id",
                "_id":{
                    "dest":"id",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "content":{
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "comments":{
                    "type":"_ARRAY",
                    "fk":"post_id"
                }
            },
            "comments":{
                "pk":"id",
                "post_id":{
                    "dest":"post_id",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "user":{
                    "dest":"user",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                },
                "comment":{
                    "dest":"comment",
                    "type":"TEXT"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Please notice the following :

- The type ``_ARRAY`` is used to indicate to the connector that the field is an array
- The additional field ``fk`` is provided to indicate to the connector where to store the root document id. This field is mandatory for an array
- The comments' mapping declares only the primary key but no mapping exists. The connector will generate the identifier automatically
- The foreign key must be declared in the comments table so it's created with the schema initialization

Finally, the connector supports arrays of scalar. Let say your Mongo database stores the following documents in the ``timeline`` collection :

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
    	"author": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    	"posts": [{
    		"name": "Check out the mongo -> postgres connector",
    		"tags": [
    			"Awesome",
    			"Article",
    			"Postgres"
    		]
    	}]
    }

One can use the following mapping :

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
    	"my_mongo_database": {
    		"timeline": {
    			"pk": "id",
    			"_id": {
    				"dest": "id",
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"author": {
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"posts": {
    				"type": "_ARRAY",
    				"dest": "timeline_posts",
    				"fk": "timeline_id"
    			}
    		},
    		"timeline_posts": {
    			"pk": "id",
    			"_id": {
    				"dest": "id",
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"name": {
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"tags": {
    				"dest": "timeline_posts_tags",
    				"type": "_ARRAY_OF_SCALARS",
    				"fk": "timeline_post_id",
    				"valueField": "tag"
    			}
    		},
    		"timeline_posts_tags": {
    			"pk": "id",
    			"_id": {
    				"dest": "id",
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			},
    			"tag": {
    				"type": "TEXT"
    			}
    		}
    	}
    }

Contribution / Limitations
--------------------------

We searched for a software like this for quiet a time and we are confident that other people would need it.
However, some features/improvements are currently lacking :

- A better documentation ?
- Their is no way to map a mongo collection to a differently named postgres table
- There is virtually no error handling, especially if the mapping is wrong (e.g. missing pk field)
- Rollbacks are not supported
- System commands are not supported (e.g. create collection)
- Only operations on the 'public' schema are allowed
- Currently, because of our use of the ON CONFLICT directive, only PostgreSQL >= 9.5 can be used

Even if this code is battle tested (we use it in production and fix for bugs every time we see one), it is far from
perfect. Indeed, it was written quickly, by Python aware (but still Java specialized) developers in a "proof of concept"
perspective. Therefore, one can easily improve the code quality, the test coverage (which is currently 0%),
the architecture or write more 'Pythonic' code.
