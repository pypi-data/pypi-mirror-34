"""
An pure implementation of a QVM that executes nearly all of Quil, via program
objects created in pyQuil and then submitted to the QVM.

The goal of this reference-QVM is to produce an accurate QAM according to the
specs of arXiV:1608.03355, that is both pedagogical and useful. In particular,
the QVM can run pyQuil programs operating on a reasonable number of qubits
(for most standard computers, programs requiring less than ~20 qubits should
run in less than a few seconds).

This is to allow fast prototyping and development of quantum programs.
Any programs requiring larger numbers of qubits should be sent to the Rigetti
QVM, currently running on a cloud server.

Nearly all abstractions allowed by pyQuil are valid programs that can be run,
excepting the following unsupported Quil instructions:
- DEFCIRCUIT
- WAIT
- NOP
- parametrized DefGates (also unsupported by pyQuil)

See documentation for further details, e.g. DEFCIRCUIT, WAIT not supported.
