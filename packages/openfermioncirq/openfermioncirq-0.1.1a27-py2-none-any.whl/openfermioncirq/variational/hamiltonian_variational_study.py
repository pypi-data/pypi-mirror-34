    u"""A study with a value and noise model associated with a Hamiltonian.

    The value of the ansatz is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in the
    state that results from applying the circuit.

    The noise and cost models are as follows:
        Cost model: Cost corresponds to the number of measurement samples taken.
        Noise model: Noise is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0 and
            variance inversely proportional to the number of measurement
            samples.

    Attributes:
        hamiltonian: The Hamiltonian associated with the ansatz, represented
            as a FermionOperator, QubitOperator, InteractionOperator, or
            DiagonalCoulombHamiltonian. If the input is not a QubitOperator,
            then the Jordan-Wigner transform is used.
