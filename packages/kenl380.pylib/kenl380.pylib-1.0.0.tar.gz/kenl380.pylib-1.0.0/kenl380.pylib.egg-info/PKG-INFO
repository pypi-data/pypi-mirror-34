        PyLib is a library of useful (to me) functions and classes for building
        applications and packages written in Python. It supports both the 2.x and 3.x
        versions of Python.
        
        Installing
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install kenl380.pylib
        
        Documentation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Read the documentation for PyLib. It is hosted online at 
        `kenl380pylib.readthedocs.io <https://kenl380pylib.readthedocs.io>`__

        Developing
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Start by setting up your environment using pipenv. Switch to the local
        copy of your repository and:
        
        ::
        
            $ pipenv install
        
        The ``pipenv install`` step is only required once to setup the virtual
        environment. After that, you can type ``pipenv shell`` to spawn a shell
        that's setup for working on pylib.
        
        `pylib` is installed in edit mode after running the `pipenv install`, so
        you can make changes directly to the code and test them interactively
        when working inside the `pipenv shell` prompt.
        
        If you're building an application, you can:
        
        ::
        
            import kenl380.pylib as pylib
        
        to load the methods and classes from ``pylib`` into your applications'
        namespace.
        
        Update the Docs!
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Sphinx is used to create the documentation for ``pylib``. Be sure to
        add or update the docs for any changes you make. This is required if
        you plan on submitting a pull request.
        
        Testing
        ^^^^^^^
        
        Make sure that you write unittests for any new methods or classes that you
        add. You can test them using ``tox``.
        
        For example, to run unit tests, issue this command from your pipenv shell:
        
        ::
        
            $ pipenv shell
            $ tox
        
        PyLib's tox.ini is configured to run all of the unittests on both Python 
        2.7 and 3.6, so you need to have both installed locally in order to run
        the tests. You can use Homebrew or Pyenv to get multiple versions installed 
        on your local system.
        
        Conclusion
