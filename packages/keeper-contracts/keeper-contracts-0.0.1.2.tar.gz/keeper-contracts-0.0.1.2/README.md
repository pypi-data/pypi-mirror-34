Ocean Keeper implementation where we put the following modules together:

* **TCRs**: users create challenges and resolve them through voting to maintain registries;
* **Ocean Tokens**: the intrinsic tokens circulated inside Ocean network, which is used in the voting of TCRs;
* **Curated Proofs Market**: the core marketplace where people can transact with each other and curate assets through staking with Ocean tokens.

## Get Started

For local developmenty you can either use Docker, or setup the development environment on your machine.

### Docker

The most simple way to get started is with Docker:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts.git
cd keeper-contracts/

docker build -t keeper-contracts:0.1 .
docker run -d -p 8545:8545 keeper-contracts:0.1
```

Which will expose the Ethereum RPC client with all contracts loaded under localhost:8545, which you can add to your `truffle.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
    networks: {
        development: {
            host: 'localhost',
            port: 8545,
            network_id: '*',
            gas: 6000000
        },
    }
}
```

### Local development

As a pre-requisite, you need Node.js >= v6.11.5.

Clone the project and install all dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts.git
cd keeper-contracts/

# install dependencies
npm i

# install RPC client globally
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

Compile the solidity contracts:

```bash
truffle compile
```

In a new terminal, launch an Ethereum RPC client, e.g. [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli):

```bash
ganache-cli
```

Switch back to your other terminal and deploy the contracts:

```bash
truffle migrate

# for redeployment run this instead
truffle migrate --reset
```

Note:
* we enable the solc optimizer to reduce the gas cost of deployment. It can now be deployed with less gas limit such as `gas = 5000000`
* no need to update the `from : 0x3424ft...` in `truffle.js` and it will use the first account in testRPC or ganache-cli by default.

## Testing

Run tests with `truffle test`, e.g.:

```bash
truffle test test/registry.js
```

### Code Linting

Linting is setup for JavaScript with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) & Solidity with [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium).

Code style is enforced through the CI test process, builds will fail if there're any linting errors.

## Contributing

We use GitHub as a means for maintaining and tracking issues and source code development.

If you would like to contribute, please fork this repository, do work in a feature branch, and finally open a pull request for maintainers to review your changes.

Ocean Protocol uses [C4 Standard process](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc/blob/master/1/README.md) to manage changes in the source code.  Find here more details about [Ocean C4 OEP](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/1).
