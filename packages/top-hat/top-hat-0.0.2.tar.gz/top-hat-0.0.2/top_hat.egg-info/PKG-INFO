        # Tophat
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saksdirect/tophat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saksdirect/tophat)
         
         Tophat is a factorization-based recommendation engine built using 
         [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).  
         
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installing from PyPi:
        ```bash
        pip install top-hat
        ```
        
        Installing the master branch from github in development mode, run:
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:gilt/tophat.git
        cd tophat
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        Note that by default, installation assumes you already have TensorFlow installed. 
        However, if you need, you can include the installation of TensorFlow in the setup extras as following:
        (choose the one that's right for you)
        ```bash
        # CPU pypi
        pip install top-hat[tf]
        
        # GPU pypi
        pip install top-hat[tf_gpu]
        
        # CPU local dev
        pip install -e .[tf]
        
        # GPU local dev
        pip install -e .[tf_gpu]
        ```
        
        ## Docker Images
        There are two provided Dockerfiles: `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.gpu`. The latter gpu variant requires [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). 
        
        
        ## Tests
        
        There are some minimal tests in `tests/` which can all be run using `pytest` or `python setup.py test`.
        
        
        ## Related Projects
        The initial motivation behind tophat was to port over [LightFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) and [Spotlight](https://github.com/maciejkula/spotlight) into TensorFlow. 
        
        There also are many other [amazing recommender systems out there](https://github.com/grahamjenson/list_of_recommender_systems)
         -- so choose the one that is right for your case.
