        Three Ways to Detect Secrets
        ----------------------------
        
        Pattern detection - use grep to find words like “password”. git-secrets
        does this as well as pylint.
        
        High entropy detection - detect-secrets does this.
        
        Search for known secrets - Some secrets are found in conventional
        locations, such as AWS keys. They are typically key value pairs. As far
        as I known, this is a novel approach as of July 2018. So I wrote one.
        
        All three approaches have different failure profiles.
