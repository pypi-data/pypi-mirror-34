NeuroCurator
============

Desktop application to perform systematic and collaborative curation of
neuroscientific literature.

This is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Python module
`NeuroAnnotation Toolbox (NAT) <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nat>`__.

This framework has been described in details in the following
open-access paper: https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2017.00027.

With NeuroCurator, annotations are: - traceable, - reusable across
projects, - structured with controlled vocabularies.

Getting Started
---------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

After having **installed Git and ImageMagick 6**:

.. code:: bash

   pip3 install neurocurator

If you would like to simplify the installation with Miniconda:

.. code:: bash

   conda create --name nc python=3.7
   conda activate nc
   conda install beautifulsoup4 gitpython lxml numpy pandas scipy
   pip install neurocurator

**Requirements**

-  System side:

   -  `Python 3.4+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
   -  `Qt 5.11+ <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html>`__
   -  `Git 1.7.0+ <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__
   -  `ImageMagick
      6 <http://docs.wand-py.org/en/latest/guide/install.html>`__
   -  `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`__ (optional)

-  Python side:

   -  `NAT <https://pypi.org/project/nat/>`__
   -  `PyQt5 <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/>`__
   -  `NumPy <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>`__
   -  `pandas <https://pypi.org/project/pandas/>`__
   -  `Wand <https://pypi.org/project/Wand/>`__

Launch
~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

   neurocurator

If you have used Miniconda:

.. code:: bash

   conda activate nc
   neurocurator

Upgrade
-------

.. code:: bash

   pip install --upgrade neurocurator

If you have used Miniconda:

.. code:: bash

   conda activate nc
   pip install --upgrade neurocurator

Releases
--------

Versions and their notable changes are listed in the `releases
section <https://github.com/BlueBrain/neurocurator/releases/>`__.

Roadmap
-------

**Ongoing**

1. Make the annotations publishable into a `Blue Brain
   Nexus <https://bluebrain.github.io/nexus/>`__ instance.
2. Stabilize NeuroCurator and NAT (Software Architecture).

**TODO**

1. Integrate fully the `Annotation
   Viewer <https://github.com/BlueBrain/neurocurator/blob/annotation_viewer/ANNOTATION_VIEWER.md>`__
   into NeuroCurator.
2. Semi-automate the Knowledge Extraction process.

**Done** (latest first)

-  Remove legacy dependencies in NeuroCurator (Qt 4 and Python 3.4).
-  Integrate OpenMinTeD annotations into the literature curation
   framework.
-  Visualize NeuroCurator and OpenMinTeD annotations directly on PDFs.
-  Make NeuroCurator easily installable, especially by scientists.

Updated on 20.07.18.

Status
------

Created during 2016.

Ongoing stabilization and reengineering in the branch
*refactor-architecture*.

The branch *refactor-architecture* is **not** intended to be used by
end-users.

New features, bug fixes and improvements are done on the reengineered
code sections.

When a reengineered code section is stable, itâ€™s merged into the branch
*master* and a release is published.
