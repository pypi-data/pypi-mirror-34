        ===========
        
        Emoji mnemonic for Ethereum and Bitcoin addresses.
        
        Bitcoin and Ethereum address are hard to short-memorize when you navigate websites like etherscan.io or blockchain.info. This project is to ease that.
        
        - Transalate address into mnemonic
        - Supported mnemonic for English, Chinese and Emoji only for now
        
        Deterministic wallets use mnemonic for private key. The same idea can be applied to public address. It's a matter of encoding eventually. The BTC and Ethereum public addresses are based on a 20 bytes (160 bit) integer. Each dictionary's size is 2048. The address is encoded in 15 mnemonic to cover the entropy.
        
        
        install
        =======
        
        ```bash
        pip install emojaddress
        ```
        
        *Only* supports Python3. A separate JavaScript version is in the work.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        ```Python
        from emojaddress.address import Address
        address = Address()
        # see examples in these test cases
        ```
