    "If this is product/system that is free to use I would have no problem in
    DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy being included.
    1. There is no licence needed or need to register its use.  It is a free to
       use system but we assert copyright so no-one else does.
    2. There are no costs due for its use.
    3. There is a manual which is available on our website
       http://www.bsms.ac.uk/research/our-researchers/sube-banerjee/demqol/
       which also includes the instruments.
    4. The information on scoring is contained in the DEMQOL manual and
       monograph which are available freely on our website.
    5. You can generate your own electronic format but we would not cede
       copyright on the instrument."
