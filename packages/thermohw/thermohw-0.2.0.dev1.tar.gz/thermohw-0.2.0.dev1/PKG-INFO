Description: # thermohw
        
        Homework assignment converter from Jupyter Notebooks to PDF
        
        This package installs a CLI script to convert Jupyter Notebook homework
        assignments to PDF (with and without solutions) and a set of Notebooks
        (with and without solutions).
        
        Given a directory structure such as
        ```
        .
        ├── homework
        |   ├── homework-1
        │   │   ├── homework-1-1.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-1-2.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-1-3.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-1-4.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-1-5.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-1-6.ipynb
        |   ├── homework-2
        │   │   ├── homework-2-1.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-2-2.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-2-3.ipynb
        │   │   ├── homework-2-4.ipynb
        ...
        ```
        running
        
        ```bash
        convert_thermo_hw --hw 1
        ```
        will convert all of the `.ipynb` files in the`homework-1` directory. You can also specify which problems should be converted by the `problems` argument, which takes a list of integers
        ```bash
        convert_thermo_hw --hw 2 --problems 1 3 4
        ```
        would convert problems 1, 3, and 4 in `homework-2`.
        
        The output files are placed in a directory called `output` in the `homework-N` directory.
