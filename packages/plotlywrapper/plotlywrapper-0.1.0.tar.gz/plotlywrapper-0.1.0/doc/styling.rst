All the charting functions return a `Chart` instance.
From this you can change various attributes of the chart, such as ticks, labels, and axes.
Only a subset of Plotly's capabilities are implemented here so if you can't find something,
take a look at the Plotly API.
If you think it would be useful for others, it may be good to expose it here.
Consider contributing a pull request or letting me know that it would be useful!
