Description: # Simple PyIRC
        
        This project aims at providing a very simple IRC client that can be easily
        used in Python scripts to ouput some results or information.
        
        The client is written in Python3, respects PEP-8 syntax and should be
        fully documented with reST-formatted docstrings.
        
        It supports both [RFC 1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459) and
        [RFC 2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812) server implementations.
        
        This project is not a full-blown IRC client. It is not meant to act as a bot
        which would listen and react to IRC messages. For such usage, refer to
        [PyPI's irc package](https://pypi.org/project/irc/) for instance. This 
        IRC client is meant to be lighter and simply send messages to a channel or to
        an another user from time to time.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        The targeted use case is to be able to connect to a set of specific channels
        on a server, keep the connection alive and be able to send messages to this
        channel from time to time when other components of the project require it.
        
        ```python
        from simple_pyirc import IRCClient
        
        
        irc_client = IRCClient("my.irc.network", "mynick")
        
        irc_client.join("#chan")
        
        # Do something ...
        
        irc_client.privmsg("#chan", "Result: 42")
        
        # Do something else ...
        
        irc_client.quit()
        ```
        
        Or one can also use the context manager if a quick connection is required:
        
        ```python
        from simple_pyirc import IRCClient
        
        with IRCClient("my.irc.network", "mynick") as irc_client:
            irc_client.join("#chan")
            irc_client.msg("#chan", "Hello & Good Bye !")
        ```
