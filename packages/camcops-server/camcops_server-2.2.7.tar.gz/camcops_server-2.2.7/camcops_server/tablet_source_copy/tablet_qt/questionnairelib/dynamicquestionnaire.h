/*

Questionnaire in which pages are generated dynamically by the caller,
and stored in a sequence so that the user can go back.

We continue to use QVector<QuPagePtr> m_pages.
Key differences:
- BACK BUTTON: pop last page; go to new last page.
- FORWARD BUTTON:
    - available when page thinks it's complete
    - when pressed, ask the caller for the next page
    - append to m_pages and go to it
- PAGE LIST:
    - as usual
    - if you jump (backwards; jumping forwards no longer makes sense),
      we go to the page you select and drop all subsequent pages from
      m_pages; state will persist in FIELD state instead, so your answers
      should persist if you go forward again without modification.
- FINISH BUTTON:
    - needs amending as now the last page in m_pages is often not the
      last overall. See below.

Rejected options:
- each task inherits from DynamicQuestionnaire and implements something
  like getPage(n); this would cause problems for integrating into the
  need for tasks to inherit from DatabaseObject as well (given that
  multiple inheritance for QObject is a no-no). So, we hook to the task
  instead.
- We don't implement multiple things like
  getNextQuestionNumber(int current_qnum) or getPageTitle(int qnum).

Instead we just ask for a callback function like
        QuPagePtr getNextPage(int current_qnum)
If this returns nullptr, we stop.

The tricky bit is that a given page might lead to:
    - end of questionnaire, show Finish
    - next page available, show Next
    - incomplete, need more info, don't show Next or Finish, show warning
dynamically, depending on the current state.

The difference between "warning" and the others can be accomplished as we
do now, using fieldref "mandatory" flags. So we only really need to think
about the difference between "another page to come" and "we're at the end",
which may differ depending on state.

One option here is to use a single function, getNextPage(), and just use
this. (We can override Questionnaire::morePagesToGo() to call it, and test
for nullptr.) The downside to this is that we might end up creating lots of
unnecessary pages, which might be expensive. The alternative is to call
another callback like

        bool morePagesToGo(int current_qnum);

and then a lazy/high-speed task can implement it as

        bool morePagesToGo(int current_qnum)
        {
            return getNextPage(current_qnum + 1) != nullptr;
        }

whereas a more complex task can optimize.
