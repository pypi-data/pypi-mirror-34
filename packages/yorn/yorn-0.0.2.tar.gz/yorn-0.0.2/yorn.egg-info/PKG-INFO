Description: # GET A BINARY RESPONSE TO A QUESTION
        
        A very boring input reading package/library. Takes a question string as an
        argument and returns true if y or yes is entered, false if n or no is answered,
        and asks again if anything else is entered (other than q or quit which
        terminates the program.)
        
        I find this useful for getting user input in a script and got tired of
        re-writing it in every program so decided to create a package for it :-)
