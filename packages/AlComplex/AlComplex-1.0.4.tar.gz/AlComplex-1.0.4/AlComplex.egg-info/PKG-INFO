Description: # AlComplex
        
        A Complex Number library. It uses its own complex number implementation. Its main goal it's to provide a more complete API, compared to the default complex number implementation in Python.
        
        It's as simple as:
        
        ```
        >>> from AlComplex import I, AlComplex, pi
        >>> 2 + 3*I
        2.0 + 3.0i
        >>> AlComplex(2,3)
        2.0 + 3.0i
        >>> AlComplex(1)
        1.0 + 0.0i
        >>> # You can also use Polar Coordinates
        >>> AlComplex.polar(2, pi)
        0 - 2i
        ``` 
        
        ## Installation
        
        Just run
        
        ``` pip install AlComplex ```
        
        It has no external dependencies. 
        
        ## Details
        
        Basic operations with complex and real numbers are supported
        
        ```
        >>> -I + 4 + 3*I
        4 + 2i
        >>> (25+35*I)/5
        5.0 + 7.0i
        >>> (-8 + 14*I)/(2+3*I)
        2.0000000000000018 + 4.000000000000001i
        >>> I**I
        .20787957635076193 + 0.0i
        ```
        
        Note that since Floats behave weirdly, we use relative equality. Two Complex numbers are equal if their real and imaginary parts are close by at least ```1e-14```. You can change this by modifying AlComplex.precission to 0. 
        
        ```
        >>> (-8 + 14*I)/(2+3*I)
        2.0000000000000018 + 4.000000000000001i
        >>> (-8 + 14*I)/(2+3*I) == 2 + 4*I
        True
        ```
        
        AlComplex objects have a basic but complete API:
        
        ```
        >>> z = 1 + I
        >>> z.real
        1.0
        >>> z.imag
        1.0
        >>> z.abs()
        1.4142135623730951
        >>> z.phase()
        0.7853981633974483
        >>> z.to_polar()
        (1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)
        >>> z.to_rect_coord()
        (1,1)
        >>> z.conjugate()
        1 - i
        ```
        
        Note that there many aliases and ways to get the same value: 
        
        ```python 
        from AlComplex import phase, module, conjugate, real, imaginary
        z.phase() == z.arg() == z.angle() == phase(z)
        z.abs() == z.magnitude() == z.module() == abs(z) == module(z)
        z.real == real(z)
        z.imag == imaginary(z)
        z.conjugate() == conjugate(z)
        ``` 
        
        There's also basic math functions, optimized for Complex objects. 
        
        ```
        >>> from AlComplex import sin, exp, Ln
        >>> from math import pi
        >>> exp(2*pi*I)
        1.0 + 0.0i
        >>> sin(2*pi)
        0.0 + 0.0i
        >>> sin(2 + I)
        1.4031192506220411 - 0.48905625904129324i
        >>> Ln(exp(I)) 
        0.0 + 1.0*I
        ``` 
        
        Note that these functions work differently to ```cmath``` functions, since very small numbers are rounded to zero automatically.
        
        ```
        >>> import cmath
        >>> import AlComplex
        >>> from math import pi
        >>> cmath.sin(2*pi)
        (-2.4492935982947064e-16+0j)
        >>> AlComplex.sin(2*pi)
        0.0 + 0.0i
        >>> cmath.sin(2*pi) == 0
        False
        >>> AlComplex.sin(2*pi) == 0
        True
        ```
        
        The functions available are ```sin```, ```cos```, ```tan```, ```sec```, ```csc```, ```cot```, ```asin```, ```acos```, ```atan```, ```sinh```, ```cosh```, ```tanh```, ```sech```, ```csch```, ```coth```, ```asinh```, ```acosh```, ```atanh```, ```exp```, ```Ln```, ```sqrt``` and ```inverse```.
        
        You can set representation of complex numbers with j, if you prefer.
        
        ```
        >>> from AlComplex import J, use_j
        >>> J
        0.0 + 1.0i
        >>> use_j(True)
        >>> 2 + J
        2.0 + 1.0j
        >>> use_j(False)
        >>> 2 + J
        2.0 + 1.0i
        ```
        
        There's also partial support for multiple valued functions. They all create generators.
        
        ```
        >>> from AlComplex import int_roots, ln_values
        >>> from math import pi
        >>> list(int_roots(I, 3))
        [0.866025403784439 + 0.5i, -0.866025403784438 + 0.5i, 0.0 - 1.0i]
        >>> # Gives log(z.abs()) + (z.phase() + 2*pi*n)*I, where n takes the values from 0 to 2
        >>> list(ln_values(I, 0, 3))
        [0.0 + 1.5707963267948966i, 0.0 + 7.853981633974483i, 0.0 + 14.137166941154069i]
        ```
        
        Currently only int_roots of a function and complex logarithm are supported. More to come. 
        
        You can also get the n-th value of the log directly
        
        ```
        >>> from AlComplex import ln_n_branch
        >>> ln_n_branch(I, 2)
        0.0 + 14.137166941154069i
        ```
