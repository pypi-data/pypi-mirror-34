Description: Python TBX - Toolbox Library - AWS Tools
        ========================================
        
        
        About
        -----
        
        Python Toolbox aka TBX is a collection of very different tools created over the years to simplify my coding.
        As a library, this has no purpose by itself and should be used by other projects.
        
        ***tbx.aws*** - this specific project relates to Amazon Web Services, and specific wrappers around boto3 library for handling EC2  and Route53 features more easily.

        Description
        -----------
        
        The library contains several unrelated tool collections :
        
        
        - **tbx.aws** - contains AWS EC2 and Route53 wrappers around boto3 library
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Just look at the code as it is commented for your to understand its usage.
        
        No big doc made yet. This is more of a personal collection of snippets and tools.
        
        But if somebody is interested or requests it, I will make a better doc.
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This libraries are used most on Linux and OSX systems, but plenty of functions may work on windows.
        
        This libraries are compatibles with Python 3.3+.
        
        Mainly tested on 3.6.
