    features: ['Allow for object uploads > 5GB from stdin.


        When uploading from standard input, swiftclient will turn the upload

        into an SLO in the case of large objects. By default, input larger

        than 10MB will be uploaded as an SLO with 10MB segment sizes. Users

        can also supply the ``--segment-size`` option to alter that

        threshold and the SLO segment size. One segment is buffered in

        memory (which is why 10MB default was chosen).

        ', 'The ``--meta`` option can now be set on the upload command.

        ', 'Updated PyPy test dependency references to be more accurate

        on different distros.

        to be

        prompted to enter a password. Any password otherwise specified by

        TempURLs with IP restrictions are supported are Swift 2.19.0 or later.

        ``head_object()`` method. This is useful for finding information on

        SLO/DLO manifests without fetching the entire manifest.
