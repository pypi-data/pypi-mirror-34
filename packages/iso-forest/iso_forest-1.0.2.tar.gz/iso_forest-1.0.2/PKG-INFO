Description: # iso_forest
        
        This is a simple package implementation for the isolation forest method described (among other places) in this [paper](icdm08b.pdf) for detecting anomalies and outliers from a data point distribution.
        
        # Extended isolation forest
        
        For an extended version of this algorithm that produces more precise scoring maps please visit this repository

          pip install git+https://github.com/mgckind/iso_forest.git
         
        It supports python2 and python3 
        
        ## Requirements
        
        No extra requirements are needed, It also contains means to draw the trees created using the [igraph](http://igraph.org/) library.
