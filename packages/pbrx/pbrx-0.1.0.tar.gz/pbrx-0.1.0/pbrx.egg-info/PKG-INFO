        ====
        
        Utilities for projects using `pbr`_.
        
        `pbr`_ is very opinionated about how things should be done. As a result,
        there are a set of actions that become easy to deal with generically for
        any `pbr`_ based project. **pbrx** is a collection of utilities that contain
        support for such actions.
        
        .. note::
        
          Each of the utilities has a primary focus of working for projects using
          pbr. However, some of them will also work just fine for non-pbr-based
          projects. When that is the case, the utility will be marked appropriately.

        Features
        --------
        
        Each utility is implemented as a subcommand on the ``pbrx`` command.
        
        install-siblings
          Updates an installation with local from-source versions of dependencies.
          For any dependency that the normal installation installed from pip/PyPI,
          ``install-siblings`` will look for an adjacent git repository that provides
          the same package. If one exists, the source version will be installed to
          replace the released version. This is done in such a way that any given
          ``constraints`` will be honored and not get messed up by transitive depends.
