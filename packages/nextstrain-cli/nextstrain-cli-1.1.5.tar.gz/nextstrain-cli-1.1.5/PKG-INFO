Description: # nextstrain-cli
        
        This is the Nextstrain command-line tool.  It aims to provide access to
        Nextstrain components in a local environment with a minimum of fuss.
        
        You can use it to run a pathogen build which makes use of components like
        [sacra][], [fauna][], and [augur][] or view the results of such a build in our
        standard viewer, [auspice][].

        [augur]: https://github.com/nextstrain/augur

        ## Usage
        
        This package provides a `nextstrain` program which provides access to a few
        commands.  If you've installed this package (`nextstrain-cli`), you can just
        run `nextstrain`.  Otherwise, you can run `./bin/nextstrain` from a copy of the
        source code.
        
        ```
        usage: nextstrain [-h] {build,view,update,check-setup,version} ...

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        
        commands:
          {build,view,update,check-setup,version}
            build               Run pathogen build
            view                View pathogen build
            update              Updates your local image copy
            check-setup         Tests your local setup
            version             Show version information
        ```
        
        For more information on a specific command, you can run it with the `--help`
        option, for example, `nextstrain build --help`.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        This tool is written in Python 3 and requires at least Python 3.5.  You may
        install it with pip (or pip3) like so:
        
            pip install nextstrain-cli
        
        or from a git clone or copy of the source code:
        
            pip install .
        
        If your system has both Python 2 and Python 3 installed side-by-side, you may
        need to use pip3 instead of pip (which often defaults to pip2).
        
        This tool also currently requires [Docker][].  You can download and install the
        [Docker Community Edition (CE)][] for your platform for free.  After doing so,
        run `nextstrain check-setup` to ensure it works.
