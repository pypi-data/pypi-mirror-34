The pyblp package is a Python 3 implementation of the nested fixed point algorithm for BLP demand estimation. The author of this package is `Jeff Gortmaker <http://jeffgortmaker.com/>`_. At the moment, the only other contributer is `Chris Conlon <https://chrisconlon.github.io/>`_. Development of the package has been guided by the BLP code made publicly available by many researchers and practitioners. Views expressed in the documentation of this package are those of the contributers and do not necessarily reflect the views of any institution to which they belong.


Installation
------------

The pyblp package has been tested on `Python 3.6 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. The `SciPy instructions <https://scipy.org/install.html>`_ for installing related packages is a good guide for how to install a scientific Python environment. A good choice is the `Anaconda Distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_, since, along with many other packages that are useful for scientific computing, it comes packaged with pyblp's only required dependencies: `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_, `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_, `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_, and `Patsy <https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

You can install the current release of pyblp with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_::

    pip install pyblp

You can upgrade to a newer release with the ``--upgrade`` flag::

    pip install --upgrade pyblp

If you lack permissions, you can install pyblp in your user directory with the ``--user`` flag::

    pip install --user pyblp

Alternatively, you can download a wheel or source archive from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyblp/>`_. You can find the latest development code on `GitHub <https://github.com/jeffgortmaker/pyblp/>`_ and the latest development documentation `here <http://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
