Description: # Radio Paradise player and notifier
        
        Radio paradise: https://www.radioparadise.com
        
        This program plays radio paradise's stream from cli and send notifications on what's currently playing using your desktop notification system.
        
        This is tested (and certainly working only) under linux.
        
        ## usage
        
        * Launch the program in command line with
        
        ```$ paradise_player```
        
        * or the shortcut
        
        ```$ rpp```
        
        * it will start to play the steam and send notification when song changes.
        
        
        * Ctrl+C to stop it
        
        ## installation
        
        ```$ pip install paradise_player```
        
        or clone the repository [from github](https://github.com/ThomasChiroux/paradise_player) and run
        
        ```$ python setup.py install```
        
        ## configuration
        
        config file is stored in ~/.config/paradise_player/config.cfg
        
        see file config_sample.cfg for all configuration parameters.
        
        ## dependencies
        
        * This program requires notify-send on your system.
        
        For archlinux, install libnotify:
        
        ```$ sudo pacman -S libnotify```
        
        * It also requires a notification server, generally built-in if you use 'big' desktop environments like gnome or kde.
        
        Alternatively, you can use dunst (https://dunst-project.org/)
        
        * playing the radio stream is configurable, vlc is used by default.
          you can use ffplay (from ffmpeg), mplayer, or any cli player capable of playing http streams.
        
        * of course this program requires python 3+ installed in your system.
