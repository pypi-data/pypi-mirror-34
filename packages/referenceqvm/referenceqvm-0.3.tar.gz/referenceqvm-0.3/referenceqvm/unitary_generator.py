    Generate the permutation matrix that permutes an arbitrary number of
    single-particle Hilbert spaces into adjacent positions.

    Transposes the qubit indices in the order they are passed to a
    contiguous region in the complete Hilbert space, in increasing
    qubit index order (preserving the order they are passed in).

    Gates are usually defined as `GATE 0 1 2`, with such an argument ordering
    dictating the layout of the matrix corresponding to GATE. If such an
    instruction is given, actual qubits (0, 1, 2) need to be swapped into the
    positions (2, 1, 0), because the lifting operation taking the 8 x 8 matrix
    of GATE is done in the little-endian (reverse) addressed qubit space.

    For example, suppose I have a Quil command CCNOT 20 15 10.
    The median of the qubit indices is 15 - hence, we permute qubits
    [20, 15, 10] into the final map [16, 15, 14] to minimize the number of
    swaps needed, and so we can directly operate with the final CCNOT, when
    lifted from indices [16, 15, 14] to the complete Hilbert space.
