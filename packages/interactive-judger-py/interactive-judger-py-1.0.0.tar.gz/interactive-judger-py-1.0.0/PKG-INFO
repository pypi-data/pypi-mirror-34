Description: # Interactive Judger for Python3
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AD1024/InteractiveJudgerPy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AD1024/InteractiveJudgerPy)
        
        This project was initially being used to help me with the Python course I taught at Algorithm 101, CSE. I modified it to a more friendly version during my spare time.
        
        # Functions
        - [x] Safe Data Loading
        - [x] Automatic Testing
        - [x] TLE Testing
        - [x] User Custom Data Directory

        # Usage
        ### Step 1
        Use `conf_generator.py` generate judger config by following the instructions.
        
        ### Step 2
        Save your test cases(parameters for method being tested) in a file and place it into `data` folder. Copy python files you want to test into `src` folder, and finally, copy your answers(corresponding with the test case) into a file and move it into `data` folder.
        
        ### Step 3
        Run `judge.py` and follow the instructions.
