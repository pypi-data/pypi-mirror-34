**XenonPy** is a Python library focus on the material informatics which be designed for material explore based on machine learning.

The main purpose of this project is to build a complex system to calculate various chem/phys descriptors for machine learning then extend them to explore material space.
To reach this target, system also provide model training routines and try to re-use pre-trained model by various deep learning methods such as **transfer learning**.

This project has just started and a long way to run. The final goal of this project is to build a **All-In-One** virtual environment for material development come with:

* **Massive dataset and Pre-trained models out-of-box**
* **Various descriptor calculation methods**
* **Model training and re-use**
* **Combined with deep learning methods seamless**
* **Visualization tools for analysis and publish ready**

XenonPy inspired by matminer: https://hackingmaterials.github.io/matminer/.

XenonPy is a open source project https://github.com/yoshida-lab/XenonPy.
