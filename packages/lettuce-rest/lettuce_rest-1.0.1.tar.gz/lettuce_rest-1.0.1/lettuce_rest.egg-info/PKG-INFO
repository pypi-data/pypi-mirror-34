        BDD-style Rest API testing tool
        
        This repo was inspired on [behave-rest](https://github.com/stanfy/behave-rest) but for a personal need I required to use lettuce so I take all the good ideas from stanfy and implemented the same idea but for lettuce.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run `pip install lettuce_rest` to download package and install required dependencies
        
        But in order to make it works you probability neet o add to your terrain.py 
        
        ```python
        import lettuce_rest
        ```
        
        
        ## Running
        
        This is project contains some predefined steps that you can use with lettuce so in order to run test cases with this framework you just need to inovke lettuce in the following way:
        
        ```bash
        $ lettuce
        ```
        
        But you can found more information about lettuce here http://lettuce.it/
