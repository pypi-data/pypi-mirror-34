Description: # libpkuipgw
        
        A library for accessing the Internet through Peking University's Internet service.
        
        ## Installing
        
        The recommended way is to use pip to install
        ```bash
        pip3 install --user libpkuipgw
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        First, initialize an `IPGWClient`object:
        ```
        import libpkuipgw
        cli = libpkuipgw.IPGWClient(username, password)
        ```
        If you are on Windows or macOS, you'll need to manually provide your MAC address:
        ```
        import libpkuipgw
        cli = libpkuipgw.IPGWClient(username, password, MAC) # MAC is a string, formatted like 5C:CF:7F:08:11:17
        ```
        This is because I haven't found a way of portably getting the device's MAC address.
        
        To connect to the Internet, call `cli.connect()`
        
        To disconnect this device, call `cli.disconnect()`
        
        To disconnect device with specific IP, make the call like `cli.disconnect("10.2.111.111")`
        
        To disconnect all devices, call `cli.disconnect_all()`
        
        To get all the connections available: `cli.get_connections()`. Returns a list:
        ```python
        [{'ip': '10.2.111.111', 'location': '22楼', 'login_time': '2018-08-08T22:22:22+08'}, {'ip': '10.2.222.222', 'location': '33楼', 'login_time': '2018-08-08T11:11:11+08'}]
        ```
        The time format is ISO8601 complient.
        
        # Error Handling
        
        Apart from `get_connections`, returns nothing when everything is all right. If an error occurs, an `IPGWError` would be raised.
