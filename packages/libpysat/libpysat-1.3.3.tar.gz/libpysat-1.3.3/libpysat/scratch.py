# Run cross validation for PLS from 1 to 15 components


# Plot the cross validation results as a function of number of components (RMSECV = root mean squared error of cross validation. i.e. how does the model do when each fold is held out in turn and a model is trained with the remaining folds?)

# Overplot the RMSEC results (i.e. how well does the training set predict itself? This tends to always be overly-optimistic)

# Based on these plots, the error stops improving significantly around 8 components, so that's what should be used.
