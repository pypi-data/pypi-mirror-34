Description: # textmetrics
        
        Automatic text metrics---BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, plus extras like vocab and
        ngrams.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        # Compares each candidate (c) separately against all references (r).
        python -m textmetrics.main c1.txt c2.txt --references r1.txt r2.txt r3.txt
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        Requires:
        - Perl (for BLEU)
        - Java 1.8 (for METEOR)
        - Python 3.6+
        
        ```bash
        pip install textmetrics
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        - [x] BLEU
        - [x] ROUGE
        - [x] METEOR
        
        
        ## Notes
        
        BLEU and METEOR use the refernce implementations (in Perl and Java,
        respectively). We originally used the reference Perl implementation for ROUGE
        as well, but it ran so slowly that we opted for a Python reimplementation
        instead. (ROUGE's original Perl implementation is also more difficult to setup,
        even with wrapper libraries.)
        
        ## Worklist
        
        - [ ] pypi
        
        - [ ] API support
        
        - [ ] ROUGE crashes things if it decides there aren't sentences (e.g., run with
          README.md as input and reference)
        
        - [ ] Add back in orig ROUGE for completeness (place behind switch)
        
        - [ ] ngrams has divide by zero error. With two simple files (two lines each,
          same first line, differing second line) running with `2.txt --references
          1.txt 1.txt` triggered this divide by zero
        
        - [ ] Demo for better README
        
        - [ ] Tests
        
        - [ ] Early check in each module for whether program runnable + nice error
          message (e.g., no java or bad version, no perl or bad version, etc.)
        
        
        Note to self: I followed this guide for [packaging to
        pypi](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/), and future
        uploads will probably look like:
        
        ```bash
        # (1) ensure tests pass
        
        # (2) bump version in setup.py
        
        # (3) commit + push to github
        
        # (4) generate distribution
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        # (5) Upload
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
