Description: # `autographs`
        This package contains a collection of tools for making graph stuff easy.
        
        ## Installation
        Simply run `pip install autographs`, and you're set! Otherwise, you can clone this repository, navigate to its root directory, and run either (or both) of:
        
        ```
            python setup.py install
            python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Import as you normally would: `import autographs`. As an example program, we can find the faces of the dual graph induced by the counties of Iowa using a half-edge structure:
        
        ```
            from autographs.faces import HalfEdge
        
            # Create a new half-edge data structure.
            he = HalfEdge("./test/data/2018_19_counties/county.shp")
        
            # Simply iterate over the faces.
            for face in he.faces:
                print(face)
        ```
        
        ## Inlcuded Tools
        (Check these off as they're completed)
        
        - [x] Finding faces of planar graphs
        - [ ] Complete enumeration of k-equipartitions
        - [ ] Making graphs
        - [ ] Grid graph stuff (?)
        - [ ] Null models

        # `autographs` Contributor's Guide
        So glad that you decided to contribute to this project! It's ongoing, and a lot of people need to use the things included here, so it's important that we leave behind a readable, well-kept codebase.
        
        ## Style
        This project abides by the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) style guides. Please read these before contributing, as it's integral to the maintainability of this project that these standards are upheld.
        
        ## Pushing Code
        We'll be using the same contribution model as [RunDMCMC](https://github.com/gerrymandr/RunDMCMC), wherein each contributing user has a fork of this repository and pushes changes to that fork. Then, when the user wants to make their code a part of the main repository, they open a [pull request](https://github.com/gerrymandr/autographs/pulls) and await approval of others (please request reviewers!). Otherwise, [follow this guide.](https://github.com/gerrymandr/RunDMCMC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
