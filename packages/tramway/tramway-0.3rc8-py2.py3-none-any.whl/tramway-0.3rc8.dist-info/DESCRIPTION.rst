=======

*TRamWAy* helps analyzing single molecule dynamics. It infers the diffusivity, drift, force and potential across space and time. It will eventually localize and track molecules in stacks of images.

The `official documentation <http://TRamWAy.readthedocs.io>`_ is now on `readthedocs <http://TRamWAy.readthedocs.io>`_.
