New catalog

Let's go back to the Application builder page and create a "Customers" catalog.

Now we select the "Catalogs" group in the project tree and and click on the **New** 
button at the bottom right corner of the page

In the 
:doc:`Item Editor </admin/items/item_editor_dialog>`
dialog, fill in the caption and name of the new catalog

and click the **New** button in the bottom right corner of the dialog to add a new field.
The 
:doc:`Field Editor </admin/items/field_editor_dialog>`
dialog appears. Type the caption and name of the 
"Firstname" field, select its type and click **OK** button.

Now, to save the changes, click the **OK** button. When saving, the Application 
builder created the CRM_CUSTOMERS table in the ctm.sqlite database:

Go to the Project page and press F5 to refresh it and click on the **New** 
button

Go back to the Application builder, double-click the "Clients" catalog, and then, 
the "Lastname" field and set the "Required" and "Default" attributes. For catalogs 
whose "Default" attribute is set, the 
:doc:`default code </intro/default_code>`
supports searching.
