Pytket is a python module for interfacing with CQC t|ket>, a set of quantum programming tools. This first version focusses on integration with Google [Cirq](https://www.github.com/quantumlib/cirq), and provides functionality to use Cirq circuits with t|ket> tools. 

#### Getting Started
`pytket` is available for `python3.5` or higher, on Linux and Macos. Windows support is under development. <br>
To install run
```pip install pytket```
Note, installation from source does not work, you must use pip.

See [examples/cirq_routing_example.ipynb](https://github.com/CQCL/pytket/blob/master/examples/cirq_routing_example.ipynb) for a quick introduction to using `pytket`. There is also a video introduction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4jhD4J3-W8). 

**Support**
Circuits composed of operations from [`cirq.ops.common_gates`](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/ops/common_gates.py) are currently supported.
