    fixes: ['mistralclient 3.5.0 introduced a new --force option to delete executions

        that are still running. However, this had the unintended impact of passing

        force=false when it wasn''t provided. This is incompatible with previous

        releases of the Mistral API which reject requests as they don''t recognise

        "force".

    features: ['Adding a --force optional parameter to delete excetutions. Without
        it only

        finished executions can be deleted. If --force is passed the execution

        will be deleted but mistral will generate some errors as expected objects

        in memory no longer exist
