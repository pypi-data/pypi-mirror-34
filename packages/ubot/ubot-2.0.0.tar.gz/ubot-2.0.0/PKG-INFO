Description: ########
        Microbot
        ########
        
        A *very* minimal class that implements the basic Telegram bot functionalities.
        Can (should) be extended depending on needs.
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        To install the dependencies inside a virtualenv run ``make install`` (requires pipenv).
        
        The webhook must be manually set with a GET to the following URL:
        https://api.telegram.org:443/bot<token>/setWebhook?url=<webhook_url>
        where <token> is the Telegram-given token and <webhook_url> is the url you want the webhook to point to.
        In case you want to reset it, just GET to the same url without parameters.
