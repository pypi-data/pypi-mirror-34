# In order to specify the tables to obfuscate you should set the MySQL's schema name where the table is present.
# Under the schema key you can specify multiple tables. Each table can have different fields with different  obfuscation strategies.

# this is the schema name
my_schema:
    # The following tables show the different obfuscation strategies.
    # obfuscate the entire field text_full in table example_01 using SHA256 
    example_01:
        text_full:
            mode: normal
            nonhash_start: 0
            nonhash_length: 0

    # obfuscate the field text_partial in table example_02 using SHA256 preserving the first two characters        
    example_02:
        text_partial:
            mode: normal
            nonhash_start: 1
            nonhash_length: 2

            
    # obfuscate the field date_field in table example_03 changing the date to the first of january of the given year
    # e.g. 2015-05-20 -> 2015-01-01
    example_03:
        date_field:
            mode: date
        
    # obfuscate the field numeric_field (integer, double etc.) in table example_04 to 0
    example_04:
        numeric_field:
            mode: numeric

            
    # obfuscate the field nullable_field changing the value to NULL
    example_05:
        nullable_field:
            mode: setnull
