        Users who enjoy using the terminal and keeping personal information on their local machine
        ## Usage
        `jlv`
        Starts up vim with an untitled entry

        ## Features
        - Opportunity to provide journal entry title before and after writing
        - The journal entry title appears on the first line of every entry.
        - The journal entry filename becomes "\<title>.txt"
        - If no title is given, the title becomes "untitled" and the filename
        becomes "untitled_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS"
        - Each journal entry receives a "created YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS" subheader
        - `jlv -p` opens the previous journal entry with the cursor already on the last line
