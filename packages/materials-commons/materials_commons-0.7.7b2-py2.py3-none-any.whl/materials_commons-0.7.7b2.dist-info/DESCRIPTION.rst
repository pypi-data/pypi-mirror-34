This package contains two modules:
(1) materials_commons.api, the Materials Commons Python API, an interface
to the Materials Commons servers; and (2) materials_commons.cli, the
Material Commons command line interface which is built on the API and provides
command line access to the Materials Commons servers.
We assume you have used (or are otherwise familiar with) the Materials
Commons web site, https://materialscommons.org/, or a similar site based on the
materials commons code (https://github.com/materials-commons/materialscommons.org),
and intend to use these tools in that context. There are additional examples and code at
the github site shown above; these include demo_project.py a script that builds
a demo project in the materials-commons web site.
