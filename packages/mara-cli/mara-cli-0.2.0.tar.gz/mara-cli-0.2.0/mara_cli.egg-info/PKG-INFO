Description: # mara-cli: Mara commandline app
        
        A 'mara' command which exposes contributed click commands. Contributed click 
        commands are exposed as subcommands. It automatically finds the 
        `compose_mara_app()` function of your app, executes it, and then calls the 
        appropriate subcommand.
        
        
        ## Contributed MARA_* functionality in this package
        
        none
        
        ## Consumed MARA_* functionality
        
        This consumes the `MARA_CLICK_COMMANDS` functionality.  `MARA_CLICK_COMMANDS` 
        must be an iterable which yields `@click.command()` decorated functions 
        (either an iterator or a functions which returns a list or a list of such 
        functions).
