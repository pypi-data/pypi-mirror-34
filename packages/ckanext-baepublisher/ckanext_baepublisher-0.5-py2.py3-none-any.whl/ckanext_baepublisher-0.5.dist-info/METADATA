==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/FIWARE-TMForum/ckanext-baepublisher?branch=master)

CKAN extension that allows users to publish datasets in the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem GE as offerings in an easy way. To do so, a new tab is added in the Datasets *Manage* menu that offers a form to set the basic options of the offering.

Offerings are **not** automatically published so the dataset creator must access this form and complete it in order to publish the dataset using the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem.

**Note:** This software is intended to integrate a CKAN instance with the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem and it won't work with other Marketplaces/Stores.

Requirements
------------

* A CKAN instance able to connect to the FIWARE Business API Ecosystem via HTTP(s)
* [FIWARE/TMF Business API Ecosystem v5.4.0 or higher](https://github.com/FIWARE-TMForum/Business-API-Ecosystem)
* [OAuth2 CKAN Extension](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2/). This extension is needed since the requests sent to the BAE must include the OAuth2 credentials to identify the user that is creating the offering.
* [CKAN Private Dataset Extension](https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-privatedatasets/)


Installation
------------
Install this extension in your CKAN instance is as easy as intall any other CKAN extension.

* Activate your virtual environment (generally by running `. /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate`)
* Install the extension by running `pip install ckanext-baepublisher`
* Modify your configuration file (generally in `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`) and add `baepublisher` in the `ckan.plugins` setting. 
* In the same config file, specify the location of FIWARE BAE to use by adding the `ckan.baepublisher.store_url` setting.
* Restart your apache2 reserver (`sudo service apache2 restart`)
* That's All!

Tests
-----
This sofware contains a set of test to detect errors and failures. You can run this tests by running the following command:
```
nosetests --ckan --with-pylons=test.ini ckanext/baepublisher/tests/
```
**Note:** The `test.ini` file contains a link to the CKAN `test-core.ini` file. You will need to change that link to the real path of the file in your system (generally `/usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/test-core.ini`). 

You can also generate coverage reports by running:
```
nosetests --ckan --with-xunit --with-pylons=test.ini ckanext/baepublisher/tests/ --with-coverage --cover-package=ckanext.baepublisher --cover-inclusive --cover-erase . --cover-xml
