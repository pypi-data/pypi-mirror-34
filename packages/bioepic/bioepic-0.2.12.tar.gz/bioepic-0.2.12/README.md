epic is a software package for finding medium to diffusely enriched domains in
chip-seq data. It is a fast, parallel and memory-efficient implementation of the
incredibly popular SICER algorithm. By running epic on a set of data ("ChIP")
files and control ("Input") files, epic is able to quickly
differentially enriched regions.

epic is an improvement over the original SICER by being faster, more memory
efficient, multicore, and significantly much easier to install and use.

The MIT-licensed code is available at https://github.com/endrebak/epic

The [documentation](http://bioepic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is currently being worked on.

## Install

epic is available for python2.7 and above. It can be installed from the Python
Package Index with `pip install bioepic` or preferably from bioconda with `conda
install -c bioconda epic`, or by cloning the repo at
https://github.com/endrebak/epic and running `python setup.py install`
<!-- , with bioconda using `conda install bioepic` ([bioconda setup instructions](http://bioconda.github.io/index.html#setup)) -->

## Changelog

```

## Quickstart

```
$ pip install bioepic
$ # you only need git clone to get the test data
$ git clone https://github.com/endrebak/epic.git
$ # -t is treatment files, -c input (control) files
$ epic -t epic/examples/test.bed -c epic/examples/control.bed > results.csv
```

## Improvements

#### Actively developed

Will be maintained and further updated.

We hope to make further refinements to the actual algorithm and make it even better.

#### Functionality

epic accepts several input and ChIP files at the same time and accepts bed files
- both block-zipped and gzipped.

Works on files of any size.

Works on all Python versions 2.7/3+.

#### Speed

epic can use one core per chromosome, which should give a speedup of < ~22-25
(differs by species) by itself. In addition, epic uses the Python science stack,
including Pandas, for almost all tasks, which means each core runs heavily
optimized C, Fortran and Cython code for further speed gains.

#### Memory

epic streams the data instead of loading it all into memory, which should result
in a much smaller memory footprint.

#### Usage

Instead of needing eleven command line arguments to run, epic contains sensible
defaults and only needs the files it is to analyze as parameters.

epic can be run from whichever location with files found anywhere on the disk.

Contains many [genomes](https://github.com/endrebak/epic/tree/master/epic/scripts/chromsizes), with updated effective genome sizes. If your genome isn't listed, please request it!

## Version

This is a beta release. Please do aggressively report issues, quirks, complaints and anything that just feels slightly off to the issue tracker. Also please ask questions and make docrequests - there is loads of neat stuff I have not documented.

## License

MIT

## Requirements

Python data science stack and a fairly recent version of Pandas (0.17 >=).
Python 2.7 or 3+.
Various unix tools found on all major distributions.

For the effective genome size script [jellyfish2](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish) is required.

## Helper scripts

See [this page](helper_scripts.md) for the various helper scripts that are a part of epic.

## Converting bam files to bed

If you have bam files, these can be converted to bed with the command

```
bamToBed -i file.bam > file.bed
```

If you have paired-end data, you can use

```
bamToBed -bedpe -i paired_end_file.bam > file.bedpe
```

Chongzhi Zang, Dustin E. Schones, Chen Zeng, Kairong Cui, Keji Zhao and Weiqun Peng for the original SICER. Please consider citing their paper (*in addition* to our eventual paper) if you use epic. And if you use any (helper) scripts in SICER that are not included in epic you should of course cite the SICER paper!

Most of the improvements in epic were possible due to Python Science libraries that were not available when SICER was originally written. Thanks to the Pandas developers!

## NAQ/Various

Answers to some questions no-one has ever asked me.

#### Why is the SICER algorithm so great?

The wonderful thing about the SICER algorithm is that is very careful about dropping windows with few reads in them. All ChIP-seq callers I know have some preprocessing step where this is done liberally. SICER pools these windows together and gives them a composite score, allowing very long stretches of very diffuse signal to be detected.

#### Why another ChIP-Seq domain caller?

MACS2 is great for narrow peaks, but epic performs better on diffuse domains. For medium size domains, such as PolII, our tests indicate that both perform about equally well, but epic uses only a fraction of the time.

#### Why not SICER?

SICER contains a great algorithm and is a wonderful piece of software, but advances in the Python data science libraries has made it possible to implement it much more efficiently. Furthermore, SICER was not made to handle the mountains of data we have now; it simply cannot run on very large datasets due to (sensible) restrictions in the original implementation.

#### When is your paper coming out?

Dunno. We do not want to write a methods paper, but rather just include a section about epic in an appropriate biology paper sometime.

#### Why the name epic?

It stands for electronic pic [sic] caller or epigenome cartographer, whichever you prefer. Or perhaps it isn't just another bogus bioinformatics acronym. Hope you find the name fitting.

But suggestions for better names accepted. On paper I liked the epi/epic/epigenetics link but now when I hear it it sounds so boastful I cringe. exorcised sounds like a slight on the original software... Mad MACS?

#### Which other ChIP-Seq callers do you use?

* [SICER](http://home.gwu.edu/~wpeng/Software.htm) - great diffuse domain ChIP-Seq caller (which epic is based on.)
* [SICERpy](https://github.com/dariober/SICERpy) - a wrapper around SICER for convenience/parallelism. Stole some good ideas from there.
* [csaw](https://github.com/LTLA/csaw) - R package. Uses an approach to island finding that complements epic very well. Requires more statistical sophistication and programming skill to use.
* [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS) - my preferred peak caller.
