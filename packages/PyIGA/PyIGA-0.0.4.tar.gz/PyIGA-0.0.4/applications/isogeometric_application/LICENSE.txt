isogeometric_application (IA) is an extension of KRATOS Multiphysics framework to assist isogeometric analysis with NURBS, hierarchical B-Splines and T-Splines. IA uses the Bezier decomposition concept to retain the local characteristics of the standard finite element. Therefore, IA can interoperably works with other KRATOS applications.
