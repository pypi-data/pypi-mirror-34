*  Name:
*     dat1EmsSetBigu

*  Purpose:
*     Set message token for UINT_BIG integer.

*  Invocation:
*     dat1EmsSetBigu( const char * token, UINT_BIG value );

*  Description :
*     Version of emsSetu suitable for the UINT_BIG internal HDS type.

*  Parameters :
*     token = const char * (Given)
*        Message token to use.
*     value = UINT_BIG (Given)
*        Value to store in token.

*  Notes:
*     This routine should be called instead of emsSetu if an UINT_BIG
*     is to be stored in a token.
