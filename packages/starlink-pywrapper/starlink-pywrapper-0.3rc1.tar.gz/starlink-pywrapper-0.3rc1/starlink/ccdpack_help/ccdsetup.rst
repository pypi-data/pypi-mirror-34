CCDSETUP
========


Purpose
~~~~~~~
Sets the CCDPACK global parameters


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
CCDSETUP sets the values of a sequence of global parameters to be used
within CCDPACK. The values of these parameters, when set, will
override those of any others, except values entered on the command
line. This routine should be used before starting a CCDPACK reduction
sequence. The parameters are primarily concerned with values to do
with the CCD device characteristics, items such as:


+ The ADC factor which converts the ADUs of the input data frames into
detected electrons, for which Poissonian statistics are valid
+ The bias strip placements
+ The readout direction
+ The typical readout noise
+ The useful CCD area
+ The definition of the BAD areas of the chip

The routine also initialises the CCDPACK logging system.
All parameters may be supplied as ! (the parameter-system null value)
this indicates that the current value is to be left unchanged if one
exists (this will be shown as the default and can also be accepted by
pressing return) or that a value is not to be assigned for this global
parameter. If a value is not assigned it will be defaulted or prompted
as appropriate when other CCDPACK applications are run.
If you are using CCDPACK Sets, then some of the parameters describing
device characteristics may differ according to which member of each
Set is being described. By setting the BYSET parameter to true, and
supplying a value for the INDEX parameter, you can indicate that the
global values you supply apply to the members of each Set with that
Set Index. In this case it will be necessary to run CCDSETUP once for
each Set Index to be used (for instance, once for each chip in a
mosaic camera), giving a different INDEX value each time. This applies
to the global parameters ADC, BOUNDS, DEFERRED, DIRECTION, EXTENT,
MASK, RNOISE and SATURATION.
The removal of global parameters is performed by the CCDCLEAR
application.

ADAM parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



ADC = _DOUBLE (Read and Write)
``````````````````````````````
The Analogue-to-Digital units Conversion factor (ADC). CCD readout
values are usually given in Analogue-to-Digital Units (ADUs). The ADC
factor is the value which converts ADUs back to the number of
electrons which were present in each pixel in the CCD after the
integration had finished. This value is required to allow proper
estimates of the inherent noise associated with each readout value.
CCDPACK makes these estimates and stores them in the variance
component of the final NDFs. Not supplying a value for this parameter
may be a valid response if variances are not to be generated by
DEBIAS. [!]



BOUNDS( 2 or 4 ) = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
````````````````````````````````````````````
The bounds of the bias strips of the CCD. These should be in pixel
indices (see notes) and be given in pairs up to a limit of 2. The
sense of the bounds is along the readout direction. For example,
2,16,400,416 means that the bias strips are located between pixels 2
to 16 and 400 to 416 inclusive along the readout direction. The bias
strips are used to either offset the bias frame or as an estimate of
the bias which is to be interpolated across the frame in some way (see
DEBIAS). Not supplying values for this parameter may be a valid
response if the bias frame is to be directly subtracted from the data
without offsetting. [!]



BYSET = _LOGICAL (Read)
```````````````````````
This parameter does not give the value of a global parameter to be set
up, but affects the behaviour of CCDSETUP. If true, a value for the
INDEX parameter will be solicited, and all the global values supplied
will apply to the processing of images with that Set Index. In this
way, you can provide different values of certain global parameters for
different members of each Set (e.g. images read from different chips).
[FALSE]



DEFERRED = _DOUBLE (Read and Write)
```````````````````````````````````
The deferred charge value. Often known as the "fat" or "skinny" zero
(just for confusion). This is actually the charge which is not
transferred from a CCD pixel when the device is read out. Usually this
is zero or negligible and is only included for completeness and for
processing very old data. [!]



DIRECTION = LITERAL (Read and Write)
````````````````````````````````````
The readout direction of the CCD. This may take the values X or Y. A
value of X indicates that the readout direction is along the first
(horizontal) direction, an Y indicates that the readout direction is
along the direction perpendicular to the X axis. If this value is not
supplied then it will be defaulted to X by DEBIAS. [!]



EXTENT( 4 ) = _INTEGER (Read and Write)
```````````````````````````````````````
The extent of the useful CCD area in pixel indices (see notes). The
extent is defined as a range in X values and a range in Y values
(XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX). These define a section of an NDF (SUN/33). Any
parts of the CCD outside of this area will not be present in the final
output. This is useful for excluding bias strips, badly vignetted
parts etc. [!]



GENVAR = _LOGICAL (Read and Write)
``````````````````````````````````
The value of this parameter controls whether or not variance estimates
will be generated within CCDPACK. A value of TRUE indicates that the
routines MAKEBIAS and DEBIAS should generate variances. A value of
FALSE inhibits variance generation. Normally variances should be
generated, even though disk and process-time savings can be made by
their omission. [TRUE]



INDEX = _INTEGER (Read)
```````````````````````
This parameter does not give the value of a global parameter to be set
up, but affects the behaviour of CCDSETUP. It indicates which Set
Index value (i.e. which member of each Set) the supplied values will
apply to. Only used if BYSET is true.



LOGFILE = FILENAME (Read and Write)
```````````````````````````````````
Name of the CCDPACK logfile. If a null (!) value is given for this
parameter then no logfile will be written, regardless of the value of
the LOGTO parameter. [CCDPACK.LOG]



LOGTO = LITERAL (Read and Write)
````````````````````````````````
Every CCDPACK application has the ability to log its output for future
reference as well as for display on the terminal. This parameter
controls this process, and may be set to any unique abbreviation of
the following:

+ TERMINAL -- Send output to the terminal only
+ LOGFILE -- Send output to the logfile only (see the LOGFILE
parameter)
+ BOTH -- Send output to both the terminal and the logfile
+ NEITHER -- Produce no output at all [BOTH]





MASK = LITERAL (Read and Write)
```````````````````````````````
This parameter allows you to supply information about the presence of
defective parts of your data (such as bad lines, columns, hot spots
etc.). You can supply this information in two basic forms.


+ By giving the name of an NDF that has the areas which are to be
masked set BAD or to a suitable quality value (see DEBIAS). This can
be achieved by displaying a typical NDF using KAPPA, getting logs of
the positions of an outline enclosing the BAD area and using the KAPPA
application SEGMENT, by using the ZAPLIN facility or by using the
ARDGEN application together with ARDMASK (but see the next option
instead).
+ By giving the name of an ordinary text file that contains an ARD
  (ASCII Region Definition) description. ARD is a textual language for
  describing regions of a data array. The language is based on a set of
  keywords that identify simple shapes (such as Column, Row, Line, Box
  and Circle). ARD files can be generated by the KAPPA application
  ARDGEN, or can be created by hand. A description of ARD is given in
  the section "ASCII region definition files" in the DEBIAS help.

If no mask file is available simply return an ! [!]



NDFNAMES = _LOGICAL (Read and Write)
````````````````````````````````````
The value of this parameter controls whether or not position list
processing applications are expected to find the names of lists via
association with NDFs or not.
When position lists (which are just text files of positions with
either an index, an X and a Y value, or or just X and Y values) are
used the option exists to associate them with a particular NDF. This
is achieved by entering the name of the position list file into an
NDF's CCDPACK extension under the item "CURRENT_LIST". Associating
position lists with NDFs has the advantage of allowing wildcards to be
used for the input names and makes sure that positions are always used
in the correct context (this is particularly useful when determining
inter-NDF transformations). [TRUE]



PRESERVE = _LOGICAL (Read and Write)
````````````````````````````````````
The value of this parameter controls whether or not processed NDF data
arrays retain their input data types. If it is set TRUE then CCDPACK
applications will return and process any data in the input type. If it
is set FALSE then the applications will output an NDF whose type is
determined by which data type was considered necessary to allow
processing of the input data. This will usually mean an output type of
_REAL (all types not _INTEGER or _DOUBLE) or _DOUBLE (when input types
are _INTEGER or _DOUBLE). This option should be used when a
unacceptable loss of accuracy may occur, or when the data range can no
longer be represented in the range of the present data type. The
latter effect may occur when expanding input ADU values into electrons
in DEBIAS, if the ADC factor is large and the input data has a type of
_WORD. [TRUE]



RESTORE = _LOGICAL (Read)
`````````````````````````
Whether or not you want to restore the values of the program
parameters from a "restoration" file. If TRUE then you'll need to
specify the name of the file using the RESTOREFILE parameter. A
description of the contents of restoration files is given in the notes
section. [FALSE]



RESTOREFILE = FILENAME (Read)
`````````````````````````````
This parameter is only used if the RESTORE parameters is TRUE. It
allows you to give the name of the restoration file to be used when
restoring the program parameters. Restoration files are described in
the notes section. [CCDPACK_SETUP.DAT]



RNOISE = _DOUBLE (Read and Write)
`````````````````````````````````
The nominal readout noise (in ADUs) for the current CCD. Estimates of
the readout noise are made by the routines MAKEFLAT and DEBIAS. These
can be used to estimate the validity of this value. Not supplying a
value for this parameter may be a valid response if variances are not
to be generated by MAKEBIAS and/or DEBIAS. [!]



SATURATE = _LOGICAL (Read)
``````````````````````````
This parameter controls whether the data are to be processed to detect
saturated values or not. The actual saturation value is given using
the SATURATION parameter. [FALSE]



SATURATION = _DOUBLE (Read)
```````````````````````````
The data saturation value. Only used if SATURATE is TRUE. [1.0D6]



SETSAT = _LOGICAL (Read)
````````````````````````
This parameter controls how saturated data will be flagged for
identification by later programs. If it is set TRUE then saturated
values will be replaced by the value of the parameter SATURATION
(which is also the value used to detect saturated data). If it is
FALSE then saturated values will be set to BAD (also known as
invalid). [FALSE]



SAVE = _LOGICAL (Read)
``````````````````````
Whether or not to save the values of the program parameters to a
"restoration" file. If TRUE then you'll need to specify the name of
the file using the SAVEFILE parameter. A description of the contents
of restoration files is given in the notes section. [FALSE]



SAVEFILE = FILENAME (Read)
``````````````````````````
This parameter is only used if the SAVE parameters is TRUE. It allows
you to give the name of the restoration file to be used when restoring
the program parameters. Restoration files are described in the notes
section. [CCDPACK_SETUP.DAT]



USESET = _LOGICAL (Read)
````````````````````````
This parameter determines whether CCDPACK Set header information will
be used when it is available. Most of the CCDPACK reduction and
registration programs will look for Set header information in the
.MORE.CCDPACK extension of the NDFs they are processing, and if it
exists it will be used to modify the way the processing is done:
broadly speaking, reduction programs will group corresponding members
of different Sets together before processing, and registration
programs will make use of a CCD_SET frame for alignment between
members of the same Set.
This header information will only be present if it has been added (to
the NDF itself or to one earlier in the reduction chain from which it
was produced) by running the MAKESET program. If it is not present,
the programs will behave as if USESET was false anyway, so it is
normally quite safe for USESET to be TRUE. However, in some cases
(especially if intermediate files are stored in foreign, i.e. non-NDF
data formats) it may be more efficient to set this parameter false.
You should also set it false if you wanted CCDPACK programs to ignore
existing Set information for some reason.
If BYSET is true, this parameter will default to true also. [FALSE]



Examples
~~~~~~~~
ccdsetup
This will prompt you to enter all the global variables. You can accept
defaults or enter the null value for any which you do not need to set.
ccdsetup byset index=1
In this case you will be prompted to enter values which apply to that
member of each CCDPACK Set of images which has a Set Index of 1.
ccdsetup byset index=2 adc=1.5 mask=badpix2 accept
This will fix the ADC value to 1.5 and the mask image to the file
badpix2 only for those Set members with a Set Index of 2. No other
values will be prompted for. If this command is issued directly after
the last example, then all the other global parameters will take the
same values as were entered for index=1.



Notes
~~~~~


+ Pixel indices. The bounds supplied to DEBIAS should be given as
pixel indices. These usually start at 1,1 for the pixel at the lower
left-hand corner of the data array component (this may be not true if
the NDFs have been sectioned, in which case the lower left hand pixel
will have pixel indices equal to the data component origin values).
Pixel indices are different from pixel coordinates in that they are
non-continuous, i.e. can only have integer values, and start at 1,1
not 0,0. To change pixel coordinates to pixel indices add 0.5 and
round to the nearest integer.
+ Restoration files. CCDSETUP has the ability to store and restore its
  parameter values from a description stored in a text file. This is
  intended for use in retaining a particular instrumental setups for
  long periods of time (so that it is easy to create a database of
  common setups). The format of these files is very simple and consists
  of lines containing "keyword=value" descriptions. Where "keyword" is
  the name of the CCDSETUP parameter and "value" its value. Comments can
  be included using the character "#" at the start of a line or an "!"
  inline. Continuation lines are indicated by a "-" as the last
  character. An example of the contents of a restoration file is shown
  next (this is an actual file created by CCDSETUP).

# # CCDPACK - Restoration file # # Written by pdraper on Wed Sep 6
17:41:54 1995. # ADC = 1 ! Electrons/ADU RNOISE = 9.95 ! Nominal
readout noise in ADUs EXTENT = 6, 119, 1, 128 ! Extent of useful CCD
area BOUNDS = 1, 5, 120, 128 ! Bounds of bias strips DIRECTION = X !
Readout direction DEFERRED = 0 ! Deferred charge in ADUs MASK =
ccdtest_ard.dat ! Defect mask SATURATE = TRUE ! Look for saturated
pixels SATURATION = 180000 ! Saturation value SETSAT = FALSE ! Set
saturated pixels to saturation value PRESERVE = TRUE ! Preserve data
types GENVAR = TRUE ! Generate data variances NDFNAMES = TRUE !
Position lists associated with NDFs LOGTO = BOTH ! Log file
information to LOGFILE = CCDPACK.LOG ! Name of logfile
If you are using CCDPACK Sets, then some lines of this file may be of
the form "setindex,keyword=value"; so this sequence:
1,RNOISE = 9.80 ! Nominal readout noise in ADUs (Set Index 1) 2,RNOISE
= 8.65 ! Nominal readout noise in ADUs (Set Index 2) 3,RNOISE = 9.10 !
Nominal readout noise in ADUs (Set Index 3)
would give the different values for each member of each Set of images.


Behaviour of Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All parameter values are obtained by prompting. The suggested values
(defaults) are either the current global values, if they exist, or the
application current values (from the last time that the application
was run). Global values corresponding to the INDEX parameter will be
used as defaults if they exist. If the application has not been run
then the "intrinsic" defaults are shown. The intrinsic defaults may be
obtained at any time (in the absence of global values) by using the
RESET keyword on the command line.
