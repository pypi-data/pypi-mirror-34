CAGE Questionnaire
------------------

The CAGE Questionnaire is a short screening tool for alcoholism. Its name is
an acronym of its four questions (cut down, annoyed, guilty, eye-opener).

Believed to be in the public domain (based on Mayfield et al. 1974, Ewing 1984,
O’Brien 2008) — particularly Ewing (1984), the original author, who encourages
widespread use (“Although the CAGE questions have already been widely used, it
is hoped that this article will serve to encourage more clinicians to
incorporate them into all history-taking with patients who drink alcoholic
beverages”).
