==================
Changing interface
==================

Jam.py framework has predefined css themes. Let's change the default boostrap 
theme to the cerulean theme:

.. image:: /intro/_images/cerulean-theme.png
	:align: center
	:alt: cerulean-theme.png

In the project's root folder, there is a project.css file that you can use to 
change how the elements of the project page look. For example, let's change 
how the customer field is displayed in the table:

.. image:: /intro/_images/project_css.png
	:align: center
	:alt: project_css.png


.. image:: /intro/_images/done.png
	:align: center
	:alt: done.png
