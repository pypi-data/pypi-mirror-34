P.S. ZProc is short for _Zero_ Process

**Behold, the power of ZProc:**

```python
import zproc

ctx = zproc.Context(wait=True)
ctx.state["cookies"] = 0


@zproc.atomic
def eat_cookie(state):
    state["cookies"] -= 1
    print("nom nom nom")


@zproc.atomic
def bake_cookie(state):
    state["cookies"] += 1
    print("Here's a cookie!")


@ctx.call_when_change("cookies")
def cookie_eater(state):
    eat_cookie(state)


@ctx.process
def cookie_baker(state):
    for i in range(5):
        bake_cookie(state)
```

**output**

```
Here's a cookie!
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
Here's a cookie!
nom nom nom
nom nom nom
```

Notice how the outputs are asynchronous,
because the baker and eater run in different processes.

```
print(cookie_eater)
print(cookie_baker)
```

**output**

```
<Process pid: 2555 target: <function cookie_eater at 0x7f5b4542c9d8> uuid: e74521ae-76ca-11e8-bd1f-7c7a912e12b5>
<Process pid: 2556 target: <function cookie_baker at 0x7f5b4542c950> uuid: e74521ae-76ca-11e8-bd1f-7c7a912e12b5>
```

If two Process instances have the same uuid, that means they share the same state.

## Backstory

Traditional Multi Processing involved _shared memory_ (global variables).<br>
However, it was proven that shared memory tends to _violate_ the laws of Physics.

[üîñ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo5WL5IQAd0)
<- Joe Armstrong, the creator of Erlang.

The solution presented by Erlang, (and ZMQ) is the notion of
**message passing** for achieving parallelism.<br>
However, Message passing can be tedious, and often un-pythonic.

This is where ZProc comes in.

**It provides you a middle ground between message passing and shared memory.**

It does message passing, without you ever knowing that it's doing it.

It provides you a global `dict` called `state`.<br>
The `state` is **not** a shared object.<br>
It works _purely_ on message passing.

It also supports a fair bit of reactive programming, (kind of like ReactJS) using [state watchers](http://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/state_watching.html).

Behind the covers, it simulates the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).<br>
ZProc doesn't blindly follow it, but you can think of it as such.

It also borrows the `autoretry` feature of Celery, but unlike
Celery it doesn't need a broker.

#### The zen of zero

> The √ò in √òMQ is all about trade-offs. On the one hand, this strange
> name lowers √òMQ‚Äôs visibility on Google and Twitter. On the other hand,
> it annoys the heck out of some Danish folk who write us things like
> ‚Äú√òMG r√∏tfl‚Äù, and ‚Äú√ò is not a funny-looking zero!‚Äù and ‚ÄúR√∏dgr√∏d med
> Fl√∏de!‚Äù (which is apparently an insult that means ‚ÄúMay your neighbours
> be the direct descendants of Grendel!‚Äù). Seems like a fair trade.

> Originally, the zero in √òMQ was meant to signify ‚Äúzero broker‚Äù and
> (as close to) ‚Äúzero latency‚Äù (as possible). Since then, it has come

> that permeates the project. We add power by removing complexity
> rather than by exposing new functionality.

## Features

-   üå† &nbsp; Global State w/o shared memory

    -   Globally synchronized state (`dict`), without using shared memory.
    -   [üîñ](#inner-workings)

-   üå† &nbsp; Asynchronous paradigms without `async def`

    -   Build any combination of synchronous and asynchronous systems.
    -   _watch_ for changes in state, without
        [Busy Waiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting).
    -   [üîñ](http://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/zproc.html#zproc.zproc.State)

-   üå† &nbsp; Process management

    -   [Process Factory](http://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/zproc.html#zproc.zproc.Context.process_factory)
    -   Remembers to kill processes when exiting, for general peace.
        (even when they're nested)
    -   Keeps a record of processes created using ZProc.
    -   [üîñ](http://zproc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/zproc.html#zproc.zproc.Context)

-   üå† &nbsp; Atomic Operations
    -   Perform an arbitrary number of operations on state as a single,
        atomic operation.
    -   [üîñ](#atomicity)

## Caveats

-   The state only gets updated if you do it directly.<br>
    This means that if you mutate objects inside the state,
    they wont get reflected in the global state.
-   The state should be pickle-able
-   It runs an extra Process for managing the state.<br>
    Its fairly lightweight though, and shouldn't add too
    much weight to your application.

## FAQ

-   Fast?

    -   Above all, ZProc is written for safety and ease of use.
    -   However, since its written using ZMQ, it's plenty fast for most stuff.
    -   Run -> [üîñ](eamples/async_vs_zproc.py) for a taste.

-   Stable?

    -   The code itself is stable, but the API is quite unstable.

-   Production ready?

    -   Please don't use it in production right now.

-   Real?

    -   YES. It works.
    -   [üîñ](https://github.com/pycampers/muro)

-   Windows compatible?
    -   Probably?

## Inner Workings

-   Zproc uses a Server, which is responsible for storing and communicating the state.

    -   This isolates our resource (state), eliminating the need for locks.

-   The process(s) communicate through ZMQ sockets, over `ipc://`.

    -   The clients (Proceses) use a `ZMQ_DEALER` socket.
    -   The Server uses a `ZMQ_ROUTER` socket.

-   If a Process wishes to _watch_ the state, it subscribes to a global publish message.
    -   The zproc server publishes the state at every state update.
        (using `ZMQ_PUB` socket)
    -   A Process may subscribe to this message and
        filter out the event it needs (using `ZMQ_SUB` socket).
    -   zmq sockets block your application efficiently
        till an update occurs, eliminating the need for Busy Waiting.

(Busy waiting refers to the `while True: <check condition>` approach).
