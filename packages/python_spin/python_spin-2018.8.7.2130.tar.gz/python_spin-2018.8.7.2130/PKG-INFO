Description: spin
        ====
        
        a small utility to assist in setting usage modes of laptop-tablet
        devices
        
        features
        ========
        
        -  automatic palm rejection when using stylus
        -  automatic disable/enable of touchpad and nipple when device toggled
           between laptop and tablet states
        -  manual control of display orientation and input devices
        
        setup
        =====
        
        This utility requires X11.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt install python-qt5
            sudo pip install python_spin
        
        To set up globally a Linux desktop launcher with icon, execute the
        following:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo wget --content-disposition -N -P /usr/share/icons/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdbm/spin/master/python_spin/static/spin.svg
        
            sudo wget --content-disposition -N -P /usr/share/applications/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdbm/spin/master/python_spin/static/spin.desktop
        
        quick start
        ===========
        
        This utility can be run in its default graphical mode or in a
        non-graphical mode. The graphical mode is engaged by running
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            spin
        
        while the non-graphical mode is engaged by using the option
        ``--no_GUI``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            spin --no_GUI
        
        By default, this utility disables the touchscreen on detecting the
        stylus in proximity and it changes between the laptop and tablet modes
        on detecting toggling between the laptop and tablet usage
        configurations. These default behaviours are provided by both the
        graphical and non-graphical modes of this utility. This utility should
        be initiated in the laptop usage configuration.
        
        compatibility
        =============
        
        This utility has been tested on the following operating systems:
        
        -  Ubuntu 16.04 (X11, Unity)
        
        This utility has been tested on the following computer models:
        
        -  ThinkPad S1 Yoga
        -  ThinkPad S120 Yoga
        
        It may run on the ThinkPad Yoga P40 and there is evidence that it does
        not run with full functionality on the ThinkPad Yoga 14.
        
        acceleration control
        ====================
        
        There is an experimental acceleration control included which is
        deactivated by default. It can be activated by selecting the appropriate
        button in the graphical mode.
        
        future
        ======
        
        Under consideration is state recording in order to avoid execution of
        unnecessary commands and better handling of subprocesses.
