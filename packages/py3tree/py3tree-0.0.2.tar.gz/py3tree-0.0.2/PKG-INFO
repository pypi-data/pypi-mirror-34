Description: # py3tree
        
        A reimplementation of [i3tree](https://github.com/sciurus/i3tree) in Python, using [i3ipc](https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python).
        
        # Overview
        
        i3tree is a program written by sciurus in Perl for the i3 tiling window manager.
        
        This project is a reimplementation of this tool in Python.
        
        # Usage
        
        Show the entire tree, including all workspaces:
        
            $ py3tree
        
        Show the tree for just the workspace named "1":
        
            $ py3tree -w 1
        
        Show the tree for both the workspace named "1" and the workspace named "two":
        
            $ py3tree -w 1 two
        
        Show the tree for the current focused workspace:
        
            $ py3tree -f
