#  Name:
#     err_link_adam

#  Purpose:
#     Generate linker (ld) arguments for linking against adam MERS.

#  Type of Module:
#     Shell script.

#  Description:
#     This script should be invoked by those building ADAM applications
#     which use MERS in order to generate the correct arguments for the 
#     compiler (or ld) command. The arguments generated are written to 
#     the standard output.

#  Invocation:
#     The script is normally invoked as part of a compiler command line,
#     such as:
#
#        alink program.f -L/star/lib `err_link_adam`

#     although the ADAM "alink" command will normally link against MERS
#     anyway.

#        Original version.
#     21-JUN-1995 (RFWS):
#        Added new awk script to permit larger numbers of libraries.

#        Generic version.
#     18-JUL-1995 (AJC):
#        Modified for MERS
#      2-SEP-1999 (AJC):
#        Add CNF library (used by C interface)
#        and PSX and CHR library
#      8-JUL-2004 (TIMJ):
#        Only have a single adam err library now.
