Description: yarfox: Cross post from Mastodon to twitter
        ===========================================
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Get ``Python3`` and insall ``yarfox`` with ``pip``.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First, run ``yarfox setup`` and follow the instructions. This only needs to be done once.
        
        Then:
        
        * Run ``yarfox fetch`` to fetch your latest toots
        * Run ``yarfox publish`` to cross post those toots to twitter
        
        ``yarfox publish`` will present every toot in order, asking you wether you want to  publish, skip, or edit them.
        
        You can also run ``yarfox publish`` with the ``--batch`` option to automate the process (for instance in a ``cron`` job  or a ``systemd`` timers).
        
        Enjoy!
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        All the data fetched from Mastodon will be stored as plain JSON files inside ``~/.local/share/yarfox``, so you can
        also use ``yarfox`` as some sort of backup.
