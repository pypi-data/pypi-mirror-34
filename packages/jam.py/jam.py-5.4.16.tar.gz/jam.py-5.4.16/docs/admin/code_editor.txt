For every item of the project :doc:`task tree </programming/task_tree>` there 
are two buttons in the upper-right corner of the
:doc:`Application builder <index>`
: **Client module** 
and **Server module**.

By clicking on these buttons the Code Editor for the client or server 
module of the item will be opened. 
(See :doc:`Working with modules </programming/modules>`)

To the left of the **Edior** there is an information pane with four tabs: 

* **Module** - this tab displays all events and functions defined in the editor, 
  double-click on one of them to move the cursor to the proper function. 
* **Events** - displays all the published event of the item, double-click to 
  generated a wrapper for the event (see the on_before_post event on the 
  figure above).
* **Task** - the 
  :doc:`task tree </programming/task_tree>`, 
  double-click on the node to print it's item_name under the cursor.
* **Fields** - the field list of the current item, double-click on one of the 
  fields to print it's field_name under the cursor.
