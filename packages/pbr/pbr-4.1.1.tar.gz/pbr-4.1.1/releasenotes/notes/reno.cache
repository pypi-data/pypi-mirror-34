        *pbr* to dynamically configure the test runner used when running

        ``setup.py test``. However, this target has fallen out of favour in both

        the OpenStack and broader Python ecosystem, and both *testr* and *nose*

        offer native setuptools commands that can be manually aliased to ``test``

        on a per-project basis, if necessary. This feature will be removed in a
