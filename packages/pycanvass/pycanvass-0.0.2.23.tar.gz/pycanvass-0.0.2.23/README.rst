PyCanvass is an open source simulation software for computing resiliency of Smart Grid and power systems critical infrastructure.
It has a unique resiliency computation engine, and it enables integration with other industry-standard power system simulation software like GridLAB-D, and Real-Time Digital Simulators.

PyCanvass was developed by `Sayonsom Chanda
<https://linkedin.com/in/sayonsom>`_, at Washington State University - and is still maintained by him. If you have any questions, or find bugs - please email: sayon@ieee.org


Typical Use-Cases
=================

- Easy power system modeling â€“ you can use it to quickly build GridLAB-D Models.
- Data-driven Disaster response design (through reconfiguration algorithms)
- Cyber-physical power grid simulations
- Resource optimization during extreme events
- Resiliency computation (also, design your own resiliency metric)
- Connect with digital real-time simulators, like RTDS, Opal-RT.
- Simulate cyber attacks for education/research purposes


Installation
============
Using `pip` 
-----------

These installations are stable and well-supported. The most preferred way of installing PyCanvass is using `pip`:

.. code-block::

    pip install pycanvass


If you have previously installed PyCanvass, it is recommended to frequently

.. code-block::

    pip uninstall pycanvass
    pip install --upgrade pycanvass


Build Your Own
--------------
These installations have the freshest code, but it may contain bugs. Please follow the steps:

1. Download this repository as a Zip file.
2. Extract it to a location of your choice.
3. Change directory to the folder in Command Prompt, and run 

.. code-block::
    
    python setup.py install

Assumes you have Python installed and already set to your path.

Simulation of unfavorable events and risk estimation of power system infrastructure
===================================================================================


Tropical Storm
--------------

In an imaginary simple distribution system that has 8 loads downstream of a substation, and is faced with sustained wind gusts of 97 mph, and anticipates upto 10 ft of water logging - what's the risk to the power grid infrastructure?

With 4 lines of code, PyCanvass can help solve these kinds of problem.

The data set is available in the 'demo_data' folder. The code to obtain the above results is:

    .. code-block:: python

        from pycanvass.all import *
        project, nodes, edges = load_project()
        network = build_network(nodes,edges)
        mygraph = network["normal"]
        node_risk_calculation(mygraph, title="Tropical Storm: Wind Speeds upto 97 mph, 10 ft water logging")

Getting Started Guide
=====================

[Full documentation is coming soon]

*Your first pyCanvass program* 

We try to make this library accessible to non-programmers, programming beginners, non-power engineers, as well as the most hardened software-professionals. Feel free to read in detail of each step, or skip - as appropriate for your skill-level. 

- Make sure you have the latest versions of pyCanvass, Python, and GridLAB-D installed correctly.
- Create a new folder, and inside that include a user_preferences.json file, and project_config.json file. Examples of these are in the demo-data. 
- Also download the example node-file.csv, node-file.csv, and threat-file.csv - and keep them in the same folder.
- Using any text editor (like Notepad++ or VS Code or Sublime Text), open the project_config.json file.
- Edit the data section of the project_config file, replacing the paths mentioned in the nodes, edges, and threat section of the file with the file path of where you just placed the node-file.csv, edge-file.csv, and threat-file.csv.
- In your text editor, open a new file and save as "mymodel.py"
- In mymodel.py, write:

   .. code-block:: python
    
    from pycanvass.all import *
    project, nodes, edges = load_project()

- Now you are ready to perform network Vulnerability analysis. If you want to find the least risk path, i.e. the most resilient path, from a node, say F1_2 in the node-file.csv in the sample to another node, F2_3, just add the following code to your program above:
    
    .. code-block:: python

        paths = path_search(mygraph, 'F1_2', 'F2_3', criterion="least_risk")
        print(paths)
