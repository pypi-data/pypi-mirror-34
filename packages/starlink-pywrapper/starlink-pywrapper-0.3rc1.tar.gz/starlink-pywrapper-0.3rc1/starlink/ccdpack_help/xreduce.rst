XREDUCE
=======


Purpose
~~~~~~~
Starts up the XREDUCE command


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This routine runs up the XREDUCE application. It is necessary as we
need to run all commands as task under IRAF/CL. This ensures that we
share the same environment (variables) as CL.


Usage
~~~~~


::

    
       RUNXREDUCE
       



ADAM parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



NONE
````




Notes
~~~~~
This routine is undocumented. It should work as described in the
XREDUCE documentation, except that the process is run in the
background, so that it doesn't block other CL interactions.
