on_open(item, params)

**domain**: server

**language**: python

**class** :doc:`Item class </refs/server/item_api>`

Description
===========

Write ``on_open`` event handler when you need to override the standard 
procedure of fetching the records from the dataset during the execution of the 
open method on the
:doc:`client </refs/client/item/m_open>`
or
:doc:`server <m_open>`.

The ``on_open`` event handler has the following parameters:

* ``item`` - a reference to the item,
* ``params`` - the parameters passed to the server by open method

The following code is execute by default, when the ``on_open`` event handler is
not defined:

.. code-block:: py

    error_mes = ''
    sql = item.get_select_statement(params)
    rows = item.task.execute_select(sql)
    return rows, error_mes

The ``get_select_statement`` method generates an SQL query, that the
:doc:`execute_select </refs/server/task/m_execute_select>`
method executes. The server returns to the client the records, that the item  and error message.
