*  Name:
*     dat1EmsSetHdsdim

*  Purpose:
*     Set message token for hdsdim integer.

*  Invocation:
*     dat1EmsSetHdsdim( const char * token, HDS_PTYPE value );

*  Description :
*     Version of emsSetu suitable for the hdsdim HDS type.

*  Parameters :
*     token = const char * (Given)
*        Message token to use.
*     value = hdsdim (Given)
*        Value to store in token.

*  Notes:
*     This routine should be called instead of emsSetu (or related)
*     if an hdsdim is to be stored in a token.
