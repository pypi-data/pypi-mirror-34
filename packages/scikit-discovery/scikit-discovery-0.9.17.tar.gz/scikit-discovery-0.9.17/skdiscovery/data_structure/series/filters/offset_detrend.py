    Trend filter that fits a stepwise function to linearly detrended series data 

    On detrended data this filter fits a stepwise function (number of
    steps provided by the user) to correct the linear fit by
    accounting for discontinuous offsets, such as due to a change in
    the antenna or from an earthquake. The final linear fit handles
    each portion of the offset independently. If the number of
    discontinuities is not provided as an autoparam, the filter
    assumes a single discontinuity.
