        Caution
        -------
        
        This is an alpha release.  While the functionality is sound, the
        packaging is probably not even beta quality.  Compilation of the
        components written in C has only been tested under Linux.
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        postconfirm consists of postconfirmd, which is the long-running
        (daemon) part, and postconfirmc, which is the client part of a
        client-server program which handles email confirmations. It is
        intended as a front-end to mailing lists. It provides
        funcitonality which is a subset of TMDA, but is adapted to
        high-volume usage and does not have anywhere near all the bells
        and whistles which TMDA has. On the other hand, since the
        whitelist lookup is done by the long-running server part, the
        overhead of doing a verification that a poster has a confirmed
        address is much smaller than for TMDA.  This makes it a factor
        1000 or more faster than TMDA in production, with a memory footprint
        a factor 20 smaller.

        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added domain name normalization (to lowercase) before checking whether we
            got a hit on the _dmarc domain lookup.  Commented out verbose wall-time

        Version 0.42.0 (09 May 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added a check on the sender address during dmarc-reverse processing,
            requiring that the sender is whitelisted or has a confirmed address.
        
          * Changed the logging of dmarc-reverse processing to use a more compact
            log line format, and commented out some debug logging statements.
        
          * Added exception catching and loggin for failures to open smtp sessions
            to the configured server and port.
        
          * Fixed a log writing bug.

          * Fixed dmarc_reverse() to not re-send to other addresses than the 
            indicated recipient.
