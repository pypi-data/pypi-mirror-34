.. note::
    If you are downloading the Android package directly to an Android tablet,
    please be aware of the following browser bug:

    - The default Android browser (“Browser”) may fail to download from
      password-protected web sites (e.g. restricted CamCOPS downloads).
      This is a known bug in Android [#androidbug]_.

    - Download using another browser such as Chrome [#chrome]_ instead. Then
      run File Manager (or similar), find the APK that you just downloaded
      (try `/sdcard/Download`), and install it (e.g. “Complete action using:
      Package Installer”).
