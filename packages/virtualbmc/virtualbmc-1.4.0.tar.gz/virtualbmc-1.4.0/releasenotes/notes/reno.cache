        it is not running. This backward-compatibility feature will be removed

        in the OpenStack Stein release.

    features: ['Changes the design of the VirtualBMC tool. Instead of forking the

        ``vbmc`` command-line tool to become a daemon and serve a single

        libvirt domain, the ``vbmcd`` master process and ``vbmc`` command-line

        client have been introduced. These client-server tools communicate

        over the ZeroMQ queue. The ``vbmcd`` process is responsible for

        herding its children, each child still serves a single libvirt

        domain.

        ', 'The ``vbmc start`` command now supports multiple domains.

    security: ['Hardens PID file creation to prevent the symlink attack.

    upgrade: ['It is advised to invoke ``vbmcd`` master process on system boot,

        perhaps by a systemd unit file.
