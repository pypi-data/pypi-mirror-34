Release Notes
=============

Greenwave 0.9.0
===============

Released 25 July 2018.

* Content of :file:`gating.yaml` can be verified by posting it to new endpoint
  :http:post:`/api/v1.0/validate-gating-yaml` (#217).

  ::

    curl --data-binary '@redhat.yaml' \
        https://greenwave-web-greenwave.app.os.fedoraproject.org/api/v1.0/validate-gating-yaml

* Parsing of policies and :file:`gating.yaml` is now more type-safe.

* Decision for compose is based on results with give compose ID for all
  architecture/variant combinations (these are stored in results as
  ``system_architecture`` and ``system_variant``). Previously only single
  latest result was considered.

* Summary messages with an "invalid gating.yaml" failed test are clearer about
  the failing tests (#260).

* Decision update messages are emitted for old compose tests.

* Retrieving :file:`gating.yaml` file for containers is fixed.

Greenwave 0.8.1
===============

Released 4 July 2018.

* Failure to retrieve a Bodhi update when making a decision is now ignored.

Greenwave 0.8
=============

Released 3 July 2018.

* Policies require :ref:`subject_type <subject_type>` to be defined (#126).
  Policy attributes `relevance_key` and `relevance_value` are no longer used
  (#74). Both ``relevance_key: original_spec_nvr`` and ``relevance_value:
  koji_build`` in policy files should be changed to ``subject_type:
  koji_build``.

* Messages for decisions contain single ``subject_type`` (:ref:`subject-types`)
  and ``subject_identifier`` (#123).

* Asking for a decision about a Bodhi update no longer requires to pass a list
  of NVRs of the builds in the update. This is now done automatically by
  querying Bodhi and applying the relevant policies for those builds as well.
  The ``BODHI_URL`` config setting must be set for this feature to work.

* Old ``RemoteOriginalSpecNvrRule`` for extending policies renamed to
  ``RemoteRule``. See :ref:`remote-rule` (#220).

* The documentation now includes a section targeted at package maintainers to
  explain how they can define package-specific policies (#222). See 
  :doc:`package-specific-policies`.

* Policy attribute ``id`` is now optional in :file:`gating.yaml` (#217).

* Policy attribute ``blacklist`` is now optional.

* In case a package's :file:`gating.yaml` file is invalid or malformed,
  Greenwave will now return an unsatisfied decision with an unsatisfied 
  requirement of type ``invalid-gating-yaml``. This can be waived in order to 
  allow a package to proceed through a gating point in spite of the invalid 
  :file:`gating.yaml` file. Previously, Greenwave would return a 500 error 
  response and it was not possible to waive the invalid :file:`gating.yaml` 
  file. (#221)

* Settings ``greenwave_cache`` for fedmsg was dropped in favor of ``CACHE``
  settings in :file:`settings.py`.

* Verbose decisions contain ``satisfied_requirements`` (#124).

* New endpoint :http:get:`/api/v1.0/about` deprecates
  :http:get:`/api/v1.0/version` (#189).

* Switch to Python 3 and drop Python 2 support.

* HTTP status codes 502 and 504 are now returned for timeouts and connection
  errors to related services. Previously HTTP 500 was returned (#203).

* Fixed giving incorrect test decisions for multiple items.

Greenwave 0.7.1
===============

Released 10 May 2018.

* The patch to enable `relevance_key` and `relevance_value` behavior on
  policies has been rebased and pulled in from the downstream Fedora release.

Greenwave 0.7
=============

Released 10 May 2018.

* New ``RemoteOriginalSpecNvrRule`` for extending policies (#75).

* In case Greenwave found no matching results for a decision, the summary text
  has been re-worded to be clearer and to indicate how many results were
  expected (#145).

* Wildcard support for matching multiple product versions. This allows to
  specify ``product_versions`` like ``fedora-*`` in policies to match
  ``fedora-27``, ``fedora-28`` and any future release.

* Wildcard support in the ``repos`` list in ``rules`` in policy files (#155).

* Both new and old ResultsDB message format are now supported.

  HTTP Error 413 (#83).
* Greenwave now publishes messages when decision contexts change (#87).

Other updates
-------------

* New HTTP API endpoint :http:get:`/api/v1.0/version`.
