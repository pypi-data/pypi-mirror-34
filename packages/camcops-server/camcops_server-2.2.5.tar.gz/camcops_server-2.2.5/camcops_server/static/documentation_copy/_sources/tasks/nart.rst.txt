Instructions

From the NART-R source:

**Instructions for administering and scoring the NART-R**

The NART-R is administered by giving the subject the list of 61 [#firstword]_
words and asking him to read each word aloud: *“I want you to read slowly down
this list of words starting here [indicate “DEBT”] and continuing
down this column and on to the next. I must warn you that there are many words
that you probably won’t recognize, in fact most people don’t know them, so just
guess at these, O.K.? Go ahead.”* [#firstword]_

The subject should be encouraged to guess, and all responses should be
reinforced (“good”, “that’s fine”, etc.). The subject may change a response if
he wishes to do so, but if more than one version is given the subject must
decide which is his final choice. No time limit is imposed. If the subject
becomes frustrated, encourage him to continue to the end. At the end of the
task, if the subject wants more information, the examiner should feel free to
tell the subject the correct pronunciation and/or meaning of each word
(definitions are shown below). If a subject asks for feedback in the middle of
the task, simply tell him that you have to wait until he reaches the end of the
task.

The examiner indicates on the scoring form whether or not each word was
pronounced correctly. It is OK to stop the subject and ask him to slow down if
he is reading the words too quickly. Subjects should not be penalized for minor
variations from the exact pronunciation: because of the irregular,
non-phonetic, spelling of the words, it should be obvious when the subject is
not familiar with the written form of the target word. At the end of the task,
sum the number of errors and the number of correct items. It is very important
the subject attempt *all* of the items. If the subject refuses to complete the
entire task, do not score the task.
