Description: ====================
        collective.superfish
        ====================
        
        What is it?
        ===========
        
        collective.superfish integrates the `jQuery Superfish plugin`_ into Plone.
        
        Superfish is a really nice solution for dropdown menus using css, valid xhtml
        and JavaScript which degrades gracefully if JavaScript is not available.
        
        .. _`jQuery Superfish plugin`: https://superfish.joelbirch.co/
        
        
        Which Version is for me?
        ========================
        
        Since Version 2.0 ``collective.superfish`` targets Plone 5 only.
        
        If you want to use it on Plone < 5 then stay to the 1.x versions.
        
        
        How do you use it?
        ==================
        
        This package behaves as a "drop-in" replacement for ``plone.global_sections``.
        Just install it :)
        
        
        Customization
        =============
        
        Use Plone's Configuration Registry to change Superfish settings.
        Filter for prefix ``ISuperfishSettings`` to see available options.
        
        For integrators you can set the following records in ``registry.xml`` of your theme profile::
        
            <records interface='collective.superfish.interfaces.ISuperfishSettings' prefix='superfish'>
                <value key="add_portal_tabs">True</value>
                <value key="menu_depth">2</value>
                <value key="superfish_options">{ "delay": 800, "cssArrows": true }</value>
            </records>
        
        See https://superfish.joelbirch.co/options/ for a complete
        list of available ``superfish_options``.
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Migration experience from Plone 4 -> 5 has to be tested!!
          There is an upgrade step which removes the old resources from portal_css/portal_javascripts
          and import the compiled resources to Resource Registry.
          Maybe someone can give some input on this and file some `issues <https://github.com/collective/collective.superfish/issues>`_
        
        - Add tests

        History
        =======
        
        2.0 (2018-08-02)
        ----------------
        
        - make final release.
        
        
        2.0a1 (2017-11-24)
        ------------------
        
        - migrate superfish resources to Plone 5 resource registry (see upgrade step)
          [petschki]
        - behave as "drop-in" replacement for global_sections
          [petschki]
        - add uninstall profile
          [petschki]
        - update superfish resources to 1.7.9 and hoverIntent to 1.9.0
          [petschki]
        
        1.1 (2016-06-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Update superfish.js from 1.7.3 to 1.7.5,
          and hoverIntend from r7 (1.7.0) to 1.8.1
          [fRiSi]
        
        - Don't break JS when jQuery is undefined. This happened for eg. on
          wildcard.foldercontents folder_content view
          [petschki]
        
        1.0 - 2014-05-08
        ----------------
        
        - Update superfish.js from 1.4.8 to 1.7.3
          and hoverIntent.js from r5 to r7
          [fRiSi]
        
          .. ATTENTION:: This update breaks css compatibility with the previous version!
        
        - Add default formatting for superfish menu based on the `DEMO SKIN`
          in the `superfish default css
          <https://github.com/joeldbirch/superfish/blob/master/dist/css/superfish.css>`_
          to make it fit the `Sunburst Theme`
        
          Superfish Menu Layout changed from
        
          ``<li><span class="selected"><a .../></span></li>`` to
        
          ``<li class="selected"><a .../></li>``
        
          since javascript could not handle the
          additional span tag for setting the `.sf-with-ul` class.
          [fRiSi]
        
        
        0.6 - 2010-08-11
        ----------------
        
        - fixed dropdown for IE7 and IE8
          [fRiSi]
        
        - replace `'` with ``&#39;`` instead of ``&apos;`` since
          IE7/8 can't handle this xhtml entity
          (http://inthemaze.net/post/2008/04/08/46-ie7-and-apos)
          [fRiSi]
        
        
        0.5 - 2010-06-17
        ----------------
        
        -  use `official hoverIntent.js`_ with docstring and versioninfo
           and replaced ``(function($){})(jQuery);`` with
           ``jQuery(function($){});`` syntax so the script does not conflict with
           collective.carousel (when both are merged to the same file by portal_javascript).
           [fRiSi]
        
           .. _`official hoverIntent.js`: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.js
        
        0.4 - 2010-05-12
        ----------------
        
        - removed desc.replace(...) and added a custom entities method to fix #1.
          [saily]
        
        - don't use version in metadata.xml for the package version in setup.py.
          the metadata version this is meant to reflect the version of the GS profile
          and must not be mixed up with the package version.  [fRiSi]
        
        0.3 - 2010-03-17
        ----------------
        
        - Replace " with &quot; to keep valid HTML if description contains quotes.
          [saily]
        
        - Made id-generation more resistent against duplicated id's. We now use
          normalized urls to generate the item id.  [saily]
        
        - added support to include portal_tabs in the superfish navigation by setting
          ``ADD_PORTAL_TABS = True`` in subclasses [fRiSi]
        
        - added some documentation targeted at integrators [fRiSi]
        
        - don't render superfish_init.js with ``inline=True`` since this leads to
          strange errors in
          Products.ResourceRegistries-2.0b2-py2.6.egg/Products/ResourceRegistries/browser/scripts.pt
          eg when adding a `StaticText Portlet`
        
          ``AttributeError: 'DirContainedFileResource5' object has no attribute 'POST'``
        
          according to the `resourceregistry documentation`_ it's better to set inline to `False`
          in any case.
        
          .. _`resourceregistry documentation`: http://plone.org/documentation/kb/working-with-resourceregistries/registry-entry-parameters
        
        - Removed caching after some discussions with fRiSi.
          We left the code but disabled it by default, enable it again uncommenting
          the ram.cache line::
        
            #@ram.cache(_render_sections_cachekey)
            def render(self):
                return self.index()
        
        - Displaying superfish menu only when installed in portal_quickinstaller by
          adding a superfish-browserlayer through browserlayer.xml file.  [saily]
        
        - Changed default values for 'interval' and 'timeout' of hoverIntent which
          controls the show and hide process of the submenu. Read more about
          configuration of hoverIntent here: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
        
        0.2 - 2009-06-12
        ----------------
        
        - Moved from full to safe compression for javascript files.
          [saily]
        
        - Removed unused class attributes for SuperFishViewlet.
          [saily]
        
        - Added caching to improve rendering performance.
