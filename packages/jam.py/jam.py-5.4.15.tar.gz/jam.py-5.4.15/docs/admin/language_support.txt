Language support
================

The language information is stored in the langs.sqlite database in the 
"jam" folder of the package. 

Therefore, if you have made some changes to the language database and installed 
a new version of the package, you will use the appropriate languages database 
where there will be no changes you made.

If you want your language translation to be included to Jam.py package,
export it to a file and send it me, Andrew Yushev. 

Please note that Jam.py is constantly evolving and by submitting your translation 
you agree to make the necessary changes in the future.
