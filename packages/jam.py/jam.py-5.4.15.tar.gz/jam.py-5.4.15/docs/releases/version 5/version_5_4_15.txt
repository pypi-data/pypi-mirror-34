==============
Version 5.4.15
==============

Library:

* Support for MS SQL SERVER added

* Jam.py supports deletion and changing of fields, and foreign indexes for SQLITE 
  databases now. As SQLITE doesn't support column changing and deletion and addition
  of foreign indexes to existing tables, Jam.py creates a new table and copies
  records into it from old one.
  
* Jam.py doesn't support import of metadata to an existing project (project items of 
  which have corresponding tables in database) now. You can import of metadata to 
  a new project
  
* BLOB field type renamed to LONGTEXT 

Application Builder:

* History item creation bug fixed

* Foeign indexes creation bug fixed
