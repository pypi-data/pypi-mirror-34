You can [download my dictionaries from this repository](./json). `verbatim.json` is for fingerspelling individual letters. `vocabulary.json`, `prefixes.json`, and `suffixes.json` are for transcribing (British) English words.

# Development

To-do:

  - [x] Move explanations to the wiki
  - [x] Write installation instructions in README.md
  - [ ] Use unicode IPA symbols for stroke notation
      - [ ] If that works, convert my dictionaries to this new format
  - [ ] Implement prefix keys
      - [ ] Integrate with [prefix support](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/issues/974)
      - [ ] Or use a Python dictionary as a workaround
