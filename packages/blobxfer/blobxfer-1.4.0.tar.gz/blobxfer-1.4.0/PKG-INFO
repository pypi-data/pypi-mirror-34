        ========
        
        ``blobxfer`` is an advanced data movement tool and library for Azure
        Storage Blob and Files. With ``blobxfer`` you can copy your files into
        or out of Azure Storage with the CLI or integrate the ``blobxfer`` data
        movement library into your own Python scripts.
        
        Major Features
        --------------
        
        -  Command-line interface (CLI) providing data movement capability to
           and from Azure Blob and File Storage
        -  Standalone library for integration with scripts or other Python
           packages
        -  High-performance design with asynchronous transfers and disk I/O
        -  Supports ingress, egress and synchronization of entire directories,
           containers and file shares
        -  YAML configuration driven execution support
        -  Resume support
        -  Vectored IO support
        
           -  ``stripe`` mode allows striping a single file across multiple
              blobs (even to multiple storage accounts) to break through single
              blob or fileshare throughput limits
           -  ``replica`` mode allows replication of a file across multiple
              destinations including to multiple storage accounts
        
        -  Synchronous copy with cross-mode (object transform) replication
           support (including block-level copies for Block blobs)
        -  Client-side encryption support
        -  Support all Azure Blob types and Azure Files for both upload and
           download
        -  Advanced skip options for rsync-like operations
        -  Store/restore POSIX filemode and uid/gid
        -  Support reading/pipe from ``stdin`` including to page blob
           destinations
        -  Support reading from blob and file share snapshots for downloading
           and synchronous copy
        -  Support for setting access tier on objects for uploading and
           synchronous copy
        -  Configurable one-shot block upload support
        -  Configurable chunk size for both upload and download
        -  Automatic block size selection for block blob uploading
        -  Automatic uploading of VHD/VHDX files as page blobs
        -  Include and exclude filtering support
        -  Rsync-like delete support
        -  No clobber support in either direction
        -  Automatic content type tagging
        -  File logging support
        -  Support for HTTP proxies
