HDS Library
-----------

   Version 5.1-1
   =============

   Add _INT64 data type corresponding to 64-bit integers
   (INTEGER*8 in Fortran and int64_t in C).

   Version 5.0-6
   =============

   When existing files are overwritten they appear corrupted to
   any other processes that have the file open. To avoid this
   existing files are now unlinked before creating a new file
   with the same name.

   Version 5.0-5
   =============

   A bug in the HDS_CLOSE routine has been fixed. Previously if you
   called this routine just after another HDS routine had returned
   an error status it would fail to execute. Note that HDS_CLOSE is
   deprecated and you should be using a simple DAT_ANNUL instead.

   Version 5.0-4
   =============

   * HDSv4 files (64bit) are now created by default. Set HDS_64BIT environment
     variable to 0 to revert to old v3 format.

   Version 5.0-3
   =============

   The hds_link script now correctly links against Fortran EMS.

   A bug which stopped the repeated opening of some files has been
   fixed.

   Version 5.0
   ===========

   * Complete rewrite in C to support files larger than 2GB.
   * First official C interface to HDS.
   * Now possible to link HDS without requiring a Fortran runtime.
   * Add HDS_FIND subroutine for obtaining a locator from an HDS path.
   * Add datChscn for validating component names
   * Add HDS_SPLIT for splitting an HDS path into a filename and components
     (used by HDS_FIND but also useful for libraries based on HDS).
   * Now uses the starmem library for memory allocation.

   Version 4.3-4
   =============

   File mapping has been changed to conform with the latest standards. This
   resolves corruption problems seen with files mapped over NFS using Linux
   kernels 2.6.9 or later.

   Version 4.3-3
   =============

   This version contains a minor internal change for compatibility
   with the latest version of Linux.
