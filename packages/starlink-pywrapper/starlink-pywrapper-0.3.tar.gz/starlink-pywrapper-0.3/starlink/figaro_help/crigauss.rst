CRIGAUSS
========


Purpose
~~~~~~~
To create a file with a profile of 1 to 5 gaussians


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
The profiles are evaluated and copied to each cross-section. This is
really intended for testing software.


Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~
IMAGE = FILE (Read) Name of image to be created YDIM = INTEGER (Read)
Y dimension of data XDIM = INTEGER (Read) X dimension of data" XSTART
= REAL (Read) First X value XEND = REAL (Read) Last X value WIDTH1 =
REAL (Read) WIDTH1 of gaussian (fwhm) CENTRE1 = REAL (Read) CENTRE1 of
gaussian HEIGHT1 = REAL (Read) HEIGHT1 of gaussian WIDTH2 = REAL
(Read) WIDTH2 of gaussian (fwhm) CENTRE2 = REAL (Read) CENTRE2 of
gaussian HEIGHT2 = REAL (Read) HEIGHT2 of gaussian WIDTH3 = REAL
(Read) WIDTH3 of gaussian (fwhm) CENTRE3 = REAL (Read) CENTRE3 of
gaussian HEIGHT3 = REAL (Read) HEIGHT3 of gaussian WIDTH4 = REAL
(Read) WIDTH4 of gaussian (fwhm) CENTRE4 = REAL (Read) CENTRE4 of
gaussian HEIGHT4 = REAL (Read) HEIGHT4 of gaussian WIDTH5 = REAL
(Read) WIDTH5 of gaussian (fwhm) CENTRE5 = REAL (Read) CENTRE5 of
gaussian HEIGHT5 = REAL (Read) HEIGHT5 of gaussian BASE = REAL (Read)
BASE for gaussian NCOMP = INTEGER (Read) NCOMP Number of componants
