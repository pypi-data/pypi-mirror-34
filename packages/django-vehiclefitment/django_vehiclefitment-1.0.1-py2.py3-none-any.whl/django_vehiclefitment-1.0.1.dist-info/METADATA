The purpose of this project is to provide data models for vehicle fitment for use in autoparts e commerce.  I am using this module in both my autoparts_api, which parses XML data from vendors and the actual storefront which uses a separate DB.

It was easier to move this code to a standalone module than to duplicate the code in both the API and the Storefront.
