# Recast.AI - SDK Python

Recast.AI official SDK in Python

## Overview

This module is a wrapper around the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-python/wiki/01-Analyse-Text)
* [Manage a conversation](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-python/wiki/02-Manage-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-python/wiki/03-Receive-and-send-messages)

## Installation

  #### Using pip

Install from PyPi using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/), a
package manager for Python.

    pip install recastai

Don't have pip installed? Try installing it, by running this from the command
line:

    $ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python

  #### With the source code

You can [download the source code
(ZIP)](https://github.com/recastAI/SDK-python/zipball/master "Recast.AI-python
source code") for `RecastAI-python`, and then run:

    python setup.py install

You may need to run the above commands with `sudo`.

This library supports both `python 2.7+` and `python 3.5+`.

You can now use the sdk in your code.

## Usage

Using the entire SDK:
```python
import recastai

client = recastai.Client('YOUR_TOKEN')

client.request.analyse_text('Hi')
client.connect.broadcast_message('Hi')
```

Extracting one single API:
```python
from recastai import Request, Connect

request = Request('YOUR_TOKEN')
request.analyse_text('Hi')

connect = Connect('YOUR_TOKEN')
connect.broadcast_message('Hi')
```
