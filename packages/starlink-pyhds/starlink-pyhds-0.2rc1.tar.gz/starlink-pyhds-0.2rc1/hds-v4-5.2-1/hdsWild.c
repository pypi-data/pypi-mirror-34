/*
*+
*  Name:
*     HDS_WILD

*  Purpose:
*     Perform a wild-card search for HDS container files.

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     hdsWild( fspec, mode, iwild, loc, status )

*  Description:
*     The routine searches for HDS container files whose names match a
*     given wild-card file specification, and which are accessible
*     using a specified mode of access. It is normally called
*     repeatedly, returning a locator for the top-level object in a new
*     container file on each occasion, and a null locator value
*     (DAT__NOLOC) when no more container files remain to be located.
*
*     In normal use, the IWLD argument should be set to the value
*     DAT__NOWLD before the first call to HDS_WILD. The value returned
*     through this argument subsequently identifies the search context,
*     which is retained between calls. In this way, several wild-card
*     searches may be performed concurrently if required.
*
*     A call to HDS_EWILD should be made to annul the search context
*     identifier when the search is complete. This will release any
*     resources used.

*  Arguments:
*     fspec = char * (Given)
*        The wild-card file specification identifying the container
*        files required (a default file type extension of ".sdf" is
*        assumed, if not specified). The syntax of this specification
*        depends on the host operating system.
*     mode = char * (Given)
*        The mode of access required to the container files: 'READ',
*        'UPDATE' or 'WRITE' (case insensitive).
*     iwld = int * (Given and Returned)
*        If a value of DAT__NOWLD is supplied on input, then a new
*        wild-card search context will be started, a new value for IWLD
*        will be returned, and the first HDS container file matching
*        the file specification given in FSPEC will be located. If an
*        IWLD value saved from a previous invocation of HDS_WILD is
*        supplied, then the previous search context will be used and
*        the next container file appropriate to that context will be
*        located. In this case, the value of FSPEC is not used.
*     locator = HDSLoc ** (Returned)
*        A primary locator to the top-level object in the next
*        container file to satisfy the file specification given in
*        FSPEC.  From C a NULL pointer will be returned (without error)
*        if no further container files remain to be located.
*     status = int * (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  This routine does not return locators for files which are not
*     valid HDS container files or which are not accessible using the
*     specified access mode.
*     -  The routine takes a "snapshot" of the file system when it is
*     first called (with IWLD set to DAT__NOWLD) and subsequently
*     returns locators for each of the HDS container files found, one
*     at a time. This strategy avoids possible run-away conditions if
*     (say) output files created by an application were later to be
*     selected by a wild-card search used to identify further input
*     files.
*     -  An error may result if any file matched by an initial call to
*     HDS_WILD (with IWLD set to DAT__NOWLD) cannot be accessed when a
*     subsequent call requires that a locator be returned for it. This
*     might happen, for instance, if the file has been deleted in the
*     intervening time. If the resulting error condition is annulled,
*     the offending file may be skipped and subsequent calls to
*     HDS_WILD will continue to locate any remaining files.
*     -  An error will result and a STATUS value of DAT__FILNF will be
*     returned if no HDS container files can be found which match the
*     wild-card specification supplied on an initial call to HDS_WILD.
*     -  A value of DAT__NOLOC will be returned for the LOC argument if
*     this routine is called with STATUS set, or if it should fail for
*     any reason. In addition, the value of IWLD will be returned
*     unchanged if the routine is called with STATUS set or if failure
*     should occur during an initial call (i.e. when IWLD is set to
*     DAT__NOWLD on entry).
*     -  The DAT__NOLOC and DAT__NOWLD constants are defined in the
*     include file DAT_PAR. The DAT__FILNF error code is defined in the
*     include file DAT_ERR.
