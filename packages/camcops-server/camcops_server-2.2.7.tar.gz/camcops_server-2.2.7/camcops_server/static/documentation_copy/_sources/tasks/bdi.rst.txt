- Overviews: see [WikipediaBDI]_, [Beck1988]_, [JacksonKoku2016]_,
  [Beck2010]_, [Smarr2003]_.

- Notes:

  - The BDI (= BDI-I), BDI-IA ("revised BDI"), and BDI-II all have 21
    questions.

  - The 21 questions mostly map to the same concepts in all versions (e.g.
    Q1 sadness, Q2 pessimism/hopelessness, Q3 feeling a failure), but there are
    some differences between versions.

  - Q9 concerns suicidal thoughts/wishes (in the BDI, BDI-IA, and BDI-II).

  - There is also a BDI Short Form (BDI-SF), which has 13 questions; see e.g.
    [Chibnall1994]_.

  - There's also a "BDI FastScreen for Medical Patients" (= BDI-Primary Care,
    BDI-PC), which has 7 questions [Smarr2003]_.

- **BDI-I ("BDI"):** reference is [Beck1961]_.

  - Distinguishing features:

    - rates "right now" [Beck1988]_
    - some questions have multiple answers having the same score (see Wikipedia
      article above), e.g. "2a" and "2b" answers both scoring 2.

  - Summary of questions, each rated 0-3 [Beck1988]_:
    "(a) Mood, (b) Pessimism, (c) Sense of Failure, (d) Lack of Satisfaction,
    (e) Guilt Feelings, (f) Sense of Punishment, (g) Self-dislike, (h)
