        Introduction
        ============
        
        Plone Archetypes framework already gives you a max size validation for files and images, but the default
        configuration has some drawbacks:
        
        * is not simple to customize (best way is to use `plone.recipe.atcontenttypes`__)
        * is the same for every Plone site of the environment
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.atcontenttypes/
        
        This product will let you customize this validation from Plone user interface.
        
        How to use it
        =============
        
        Just add the product to the buildout and install it in the site you want to use.
        
        A new "*Limit file size settings*" option will be added in the control panel, where you can change the
        *File* and *Image* attachments.
        
        No users will be able to upload files that exceed the limit. Also in TinyMCE text editor.

        Advanced use
        ------------
        
        While default general purpose file and image settings can be OK for most common scenarios,
        you can also define custom settings for specific content types: just fill the
        "**Settings for other content types and fields**" section.

           :alt: Type's settings
        
        Configuration in that section wins over global configuration.
        
        Validator bypass
        ================
        
        If some users need to bypass the validation and upload some larger files, there is a new permission
        "*collective.limitfilesizepanel: Bypass limit size*" that allows to do this.
        
        You only need to set this permission to some roles, and they'll have no upload limits.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        This products has been tested on:
        
        * Plone 3.3
        * Plone 4.2
        * Plone 4.3
        
        It's based on `plone.app.registry`__ that it not part of Plone on 3.3 version. You need to be
        sure that a compatible version is used (in my experience: use `version 1.0b1`__).
