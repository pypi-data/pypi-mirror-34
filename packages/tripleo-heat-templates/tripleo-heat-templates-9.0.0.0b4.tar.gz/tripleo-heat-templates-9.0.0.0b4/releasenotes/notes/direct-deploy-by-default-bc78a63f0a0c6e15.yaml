upgrade:

    Ironic in the containerized undercloud now uses the ``direct`` deploy
    interface by default for better performance and scalability. See
    `the direct deploy documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/interfaces/deploy.html#direct-deploy>`_
    for details.

    If undesired, this change can be reverted per node by setting the node's
    ``deploy_interface`` field to ``iscsi`` or globally by changing the new
    ``IronicDefaultDeployInterface`` to empty string.
