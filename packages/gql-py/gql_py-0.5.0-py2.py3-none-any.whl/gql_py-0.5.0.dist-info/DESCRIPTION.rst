*GraphQL Client for Pythonistas*

gql_py is a Pythonic interface around graphQL APIs.

You've got a graphQL API, and you want to talk to it, right? For those of us who love HTTP standards, GraphQL's use of HTTP is questionable at best. The goal of this library is to remove the fuss of HTTP so you can deal with graphQL directly. Just how graphQL's developers intended.

.. code-block:: python

  from gql_py import Gql

  gql = Gql(api='https://example.com/graphql')

  query = '''
  query ($bookId: ID!) {
      book(id: $bookId) {
        id
        title
        author
      }
    }
  '''
  variables = {
    'book_id': '654'
  }

  response = qgl.send(query=query, variables=variables)

  response.ok
  >>> True

  response.errors
  >>> None

  response.data
  >>> {'book': {'id': '654', 'title': 'Ursula K. Le Guin', 'title': 'A Wizard of Earthsea'}}


📖 Features
--------

- No need to handle the HTTP layer. (You can still set HTTP headers, though!)
- Responses come back as named tuples - even errors!
- Python 3.6+

✨ Future goals
---------------

- Draw graphQL queries & mutations with Python code.
- Hydrate API responses into Python objects.

🏗 Status
----------

gql.py is currently under development.

This package was created with Cookiecutter_.

We use `Python Requests`_ for talking HTTP.
