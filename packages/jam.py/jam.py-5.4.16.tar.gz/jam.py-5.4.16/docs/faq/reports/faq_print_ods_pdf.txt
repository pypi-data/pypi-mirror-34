When printing a report I get an ods file instead of pdf
=======================================================

When a report is generated the server application first creates an ods file.

If 
:doc:`extension </refs/client/report/at_extension>`
attribute of the report is set to 'pdf' or any other format except 'ods', the
application first creates an ods file and then uses LibreOffice / OpenOffice 
in "headless" mode to convert the ods file to that format.

If LibreOffice / OpenOffice is currently running on the server this conversion
doesn't happen. You have to close LibreOffice / OpenOffice on the server for 
the conversion to take place.
