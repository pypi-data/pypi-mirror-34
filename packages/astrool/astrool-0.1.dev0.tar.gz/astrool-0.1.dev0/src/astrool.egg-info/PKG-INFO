        FAQ
        ===
        
        What's up with the name?
        ------------------------
        
        astrool is made up of astro + tools. So basically, we are trying to come up with an aggregated software.
        
        
        What's the future of the project?
        ---------------------------------
        
        astrool is a very new project and we aim to develop it further so that it can become one
        package for all in basic astronomy.
