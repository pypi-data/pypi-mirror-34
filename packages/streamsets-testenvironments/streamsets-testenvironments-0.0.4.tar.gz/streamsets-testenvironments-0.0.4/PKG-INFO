        StreamSets Test Environments
        ============================
        This repository is home to the **StreamSets Test Environments (STE)**. It is designed to be run as a command line
        program. STE provides mechanism to start and stop environments which you can use to test against.
        For example, a command such as
        ```
        ste start CDH_5.12.0
        ```
        will start a 2 node clusterdock CDH 5.12.0 cluster without requiring knowledge of the specific arguments to pass to
        clusterdock. Similarly
        ```
        ste stop CDH_5.12.0
        ```
        will stop the clusterdock CDH 5.12.0 cluster and do any necessary cleanup.
        The goal of STE is to simplify starting and stopping environments so as they can be easily used for
        testing or development.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        **Pre-requisites**
        
        - Python 3.X
        - A recent version of Docker
        
        **Installation**
        
        To install STE, simply use `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_ (or pipenv):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip3 install streamsets-testenvironments
        
        Commands
        --------
        The following are some commands you can use with STE. In the examples here, we'll use MySQL_5.7
        
        Start an environment:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste start MySQL_5.7
        
        Stop an environment:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste stop MySQL_5.7
        
        Dry run without starting an environment (and also running in verbose mode):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste -v start --dry-run MySQL_5.7
        
        STE general help:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste -h
        
        STE start environment help (lists available environments which can be started):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste start -h
        
        STE stop environment help (lists available environments which can be stopped):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste stop -h
        
        STE start help for an environment:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste start MySQL_5.7 -h
        
        STE stop help for an environment:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ ste stop MySQL_5.7 -h
