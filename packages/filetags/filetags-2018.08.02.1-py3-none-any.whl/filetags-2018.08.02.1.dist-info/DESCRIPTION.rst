This Python script adds or removes tags to file names in the following
form:

- file without time stamp in name -- tag2.txt
- file name with several tags -- tag1 tag2.jpeg
- another example file name with multiple example tags -- fun videos kids.mpeg
- 2013-05-09 a file name with ISO date stamp in name -- tag1.jpg
- 2013-05-09T16.17 file name with time stamp -- tag3.csv

The script accepts an arbitrary number of files (see your shell for
possible length limitations).

- Target group: users who are able to use command line tools and who
  are using tags in file names.
- Hosted and documented on github: https://github.com/novoid/filetags
