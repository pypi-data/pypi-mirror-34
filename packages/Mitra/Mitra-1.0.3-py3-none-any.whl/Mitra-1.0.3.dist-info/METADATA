#                                                 Mitra:1.0.3 Matrix library in python3

Mitra is Matrix library in python for matematical Matrix opertions. It
	supports python3 and any kind of OS (OS INDEPENDENT). Mitra is using object-
	oriented approach to solve real world Matrix problem.


	SOME RESTRICTIONS:
		It will not be applicable on any string or complex number Matrix 
		operations. It will only be able to solve decimal number Matrix 
		operations.

	FEATURES:
		1) It is able to perform all the basic operations of Matrix like
		(Transpose, Inverse, Multiplication, Addition) etc.

		2) It handles Matrix and Square Matrix differently.

		3) It can solve linear equation problem with defined global function.
