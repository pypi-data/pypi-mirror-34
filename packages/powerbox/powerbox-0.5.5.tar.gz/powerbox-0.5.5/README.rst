**Make arbitrarily structured, arbitrary-dimension boxes and log-normal mocks.**

``powerbox`` is a pure-python code for creating density grids (or boxes) that have an arbitrary two-point distribution
(i.e. power spectrum). Primary motivations for creating the code were the simple creation of log-normal mock galaxy
distributions, but the methodology can be used for other applications.

Features
--------
* Works in any number of dimensions.
* Really simple.
* Arbitrary isotropic power-spectra.
* Create Gaussian or Log-Normal fields
* Create discrete samples following the field, assuming it describes an over-density.
* Measure power spectra of output fields to ensure consistency.
* Seamlessly uses pyFFTW if available for ~double the speed.

Installation
------------
Clone/Download then ``pip install .``. Or just ``pip install powerbox``.
