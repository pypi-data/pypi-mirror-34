        Installing
        ----------
        
        GTimeLog is packaged for Debian and Ubuntu::
        
          sudo apt-get install gtimelog
        
        For Ubuntu, a newer version can usually be found in the PPA:
        
          https://launchpad.net/~gtimelog-dev/+archive/ppa
        
        You can fetch the latest released version from PyPI ::
        
          $ pip install gtimelog
          $ gtimelog
        
        You can run it from a source checkout without an explicit installation step::
        
          $ git clone https://github.com/gtimelog/gtimelog
          $ cd gtimelog
          $ make
          $ ./gtimelog
        
        System requirements:
        
        - Python (2.7 or 3.3+)
        - PyGObject
        - gobject-introspection type libraries for GTK+, Pango
        - GTK+ 3.10 or newer (3.14 or newer for best results)
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        This is work in progress:
        
        - `docs/index.rst`_ contains an overview
        - `docs/formats.rst`_ describes the file formats

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.11.1 (2018-07-18)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * The undocmented remote task list over HTTP(S) feature is now able to ask
          for basic HTTP authentication credentials and store them in gnome-keyring
          (GH: #109).
        
        * Bugfix: entries with just a category and no task that did not have
          a trailing space after the ':' were considered to be uncategorized
          (GH: #117).
        
        * Add Python 3.7 support.
        
        * Drop Python 3.3 support.
        
        
        0.11 (2017-12-16)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * A complete rewrite of the user interface, to better fit GNOME 3 (GH: #31).
          Requires GTK+ 3.10, but newer versions are better.
        
        * History browsing can show you weeks/months, not just days.
        
        * You can filter the displayed tasks, with a total shown at the bottom
          (GH: #88).
        
        * There's now a preferences dialog (GH: #47).
        
        * Window size and task pane size/visibility are remembered across
          restarts (GH: #30).
        
        * Settings are stored in GSettings.  The old config file will be imported
          on first startup.
        
        * Work hours and office hours are separate settings now (GH: #46).
        
        * Native support for emailing reports.  Requires a configured MTA on the
          local machine (i.e. /usr/sbin/sendmail).
        
        * There's a help page listing all the keyboard shortcuts.
        
        * The user interface can be translated (and is translated into Lithuanian).
          Reports are an exception (GH: #45).
        
        * More efficient file change watching (GH: #11).
        
        * Dropped features:
        
          - No more tray icons.
          - Dropped --tray, --toggle, --quit, --sample-config command
            line options.
          - The "Reload" menu option and hot key are gone -- reloading is automatic now.
          - Report for a custom date range is gone.
          - "Complete report in spreadsheet" is gone.
          - "Work/slacking stats in spreadsheet" is gone.
          - Setting for editor is gone: the default file association for text
            files will be used.
          - Settings for mailer is gone: mail sending is internal now.
          - Setting for spreadsheet is gone.
          - Separate setting to show remaining office hours is gone (set office hours
            to 0 to hide the estimate).
        
        
        0.10.0 (2015-09-29)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Use Tango colors in the main text buffer (GH: #13).
        
        * Allow tagging entries (GH: #19)
        
          - The syntax is ``category: text -- tag1 tag2``
          - Per-tag summaries show up in reports
        
        * Use GtkApplication instead of own DBus server for enforcing single-instance.
        
          - Drop --replace, --ignore-dbus command-line options because of this.
          - Require glib and gio to be version 2.40 or newer for sane
            GtkApplication-based command line parsing
            (check with ``pkg-config --modversion glib-2.0 gio-2.0``).
        
        * Remove obsolete code:
        
          - Drop support for Python 2.6 (PyGObject dropped support for it long ago).
          - Drop PyGtk/Gtk+ 2 support code (it didn't work since 0.9.1 anyway).
          - Drop EggTrayIcon support (it was for Gtk+ 2 only anyway).
          - Drop the --prefer-pygtk command-line option.
        
        * Disable tray icon by default for new users (existing gtimelogrc files will be
          untouched).
        
        * Improve tray icon selection logic for best contrast (GH: #29).
