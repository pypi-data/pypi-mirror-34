  - [ ] git tag -s -u 68666A7A -m "release Tahoe-LAFS-X.Y.Z" tahoe-lafs-X.Y.Z
    - produces a "signed tag"
  - [ ] build locally to make sure the release is reporting itself as the
    intended version, make tarballs too (for comparison only)

    necessary (TODO: pushing just 1.12.0b2 was insufficient: travis fired,
