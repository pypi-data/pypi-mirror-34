/* Invocation:								    */
/*    rec1_find_file( fspec, fspec_len, pid, stream )			    */

/* Description:								    */
/*    This routine creates a child process to execute a shell script which  */
/*    searches for wild-carded files. Shell meta-characters are		    */
/*    interpreted, including pattern matching, environment variable	    */
/*    expansion and command substitution. Defaulting of the file type	    */
/*    extension to ".sdf" takes place when appropriate. A space-separated   */
/*    list of wild-card file specifications may also be supplied.	    */
/*									    */
/*    The returned file names may be absolute path names, or may be	    */
/*    relative to the current working directory. Files given explicitly	    */
/*    (i.e. without pattern-matching characters) are not checked for	    */
/*    existence. File specifications containing pattern-matching characters */
/*    which do not match any file may also be returned as file names	    */
/*    (depending on the shell in use, as determined by the HDS_SHELL tuning */
/*    parameter).							    */
/*									    */
/*    The routine returns a file stream attached to the shell process and   */
/*    open for reading. The names of the files found can be read from this  */
/*    stream; they are separated by white space and terminated by the end   */
/*    of file.								    */

/* Parameters:								    */
/*    const char *fspec							    */
/*	 Pointer to a char array containing the file specification to be    */
/*	 expanded (not null terminated). Leading and trailing white space   */
/*	 is ignored.							    */
/*    INT fspec_len							    */
/*       The number of characters in the file specification.		    */
/*    pid_t *pid							    */
/*	 Pointer to an integer of type pid_t into which the routine will    */
/*	 write the process ID of the child process which is created to	    */
/*	 execute the shell script.  It is the caller's responsibility to    */
/*	 ensure that the created process terminates correctly and to wait   */
/*	 for it (e.g. with the waitpid function).			    */
/*    FILE **stream							    */
/*	 The pointer *stream will be set by this routine to identify the    */
/*	 file stream from which the list of files found may be read. It is  */
/*	 the caller's reponsibility to close this stream when it is no	    */
/*	 longer required.						    */

/* Returned Value:							    */
/*    void								    */

/* Notes:								    */
/*    -  A *pid value of (pid_t) -1 and a *stream value of NULL will be	    */
/*    returned if this routine is called with the global status set, or if  */
/*    it should fail for any reason.					    */
/*    -  The standard error stream of the shell process is routed to the    */
/*    null device (i.e. error messages from this process are suppressed).   */
/*    -  This routine is not implemented on VMS systems.		    */
