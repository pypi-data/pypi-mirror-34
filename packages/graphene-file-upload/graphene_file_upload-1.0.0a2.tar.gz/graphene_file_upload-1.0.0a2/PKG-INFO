Description: graphene-file-upload
        ====================
        
        ``graphene-file-upload`` is a drop in replacement for the the GraphQL
        view in Graphene for Django, and for Flask-Graphql. It supports
        multi-part file uploads that adhere to the `Multipart
        Request Spec <https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec>`__.
        
        Installation:
        -------------
        
        ``pip install graphene-file-upload``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To add an upload type to your mutation, import and use ``Upload``.
        Upload is a scalar type.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from graphene_file_upload.scalars import Upload
        
            class UploadMutation(graphene.Mutation):
                class Arguments:
                    file = Upload(required=True)
        
                success = graphene.Boolean()
        
                def mutate(self, info, file, **kwargs):
                    # do something with your file
        
                    return UploadMutation(success=True)
        
        Django Integration:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To use, import the view, then add to your list of urls (replace previous
        GraphQL view).
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from graphene_file_upload.django import FileUploadGraphQLView
        
            urlpatterns = [
              url(r'^graphql', FileUploadGraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True)),
            ]
        
        Flask Integration:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Note that ``flask-graphql`` version ``<2.0`` is not supported. At the
        time of writing this README, you must install ``flask-graphql`` with
        ``pip install --pre flask-graphql``
        
        Simply import the modified view and create a new url rule on your app:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from graphene_file_upload.flask import FileUploadGraphQLView
        
            app.add_url_rule(
                '/graphql',
                view_func=FileUploadGraphQLView.as_view(
                  ...
                )
            )
        
        Testing:
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        TO-DO, still need to write tests for Django and Flask views.
        
        Packaging for PyPi:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Build the distribution.
        
        ``python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel``
        
        Upload to PyPi test servers.
        
        ``twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*``
        
        Upload to PyPi production servers.
        
        ``twine upload dist/*``
