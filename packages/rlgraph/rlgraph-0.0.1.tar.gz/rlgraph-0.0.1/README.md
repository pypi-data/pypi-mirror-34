# RLGraph
A Framework for Flexible Deep Reinforcement Learning Graphs

RLGraph is a framework to quickly prototype, define and execute reinforcement learning
algorithms both in research and practice.
 
RLGraph exposes a well defined API for using agents, and offers a novel component concept for testing and assembly.
By separating graph definition, compilation and execution, multiple distributed backends
and device management can be accessed without modifying agent definitions.
