# Prinder
Pull Request reminder for Github.

## Installation and Configuration
On *nix systems:-

1. Install Prinder using pip. 
```bash
pip install prinder
```
2. Create a configuration file. The default filename is **prinder_config.yaml** but you can name it whatever you want. Fill in all the fields or leave them empty if you don't need them. Copy the config template from here - [prinder_config.yaml.template](https://github.com/masterlittle/Prinder/blob/master/prinder_config.yaml.template)

3. Get a github auth token with relevant access and assign it to the environment variable **PRINDER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN** or assign it in the configuration file to **github_api_token**. (Copying the token to the file is not recommended)

4. Run the command with the file name as argument if required. If no argument is passed, it will try to find prinder_config.yaml in the working directory. The debug parameter can be passed to turn on detailed logging. 
```bash
prinder --config_file=<your-configuration-file-path>
eg -
    1. prinder
    2. prinder --config_file=prinder_config.yml
    3. prinder --debug
```

5. The logs of the service can be found at /var/logs/prinder.log

### Prinder has a number of configurations using which you can configure hooks to Slack or Email. Some important ones are:

1. *organization_name*: The organization name for which to get pull requests.
2. *list_of_repos*: Provide a list of repos for which to get pending pull requests.
3. *topics*: Provide a list of topics attached to repositories for which to get pending pull requests.
4. *ignore_repos*: List of repos which should be ignored.
5. *slack:post_as_user*: The name which will be shown on Slack.
6. *initial_message*: The text that will appear at the the top in the notification hooks.

### Send pull request reminders to Slack
Get a slack token and assign it to the environment variable **PRINDER_SLACK_API_TOKEN** or assign it in the configuration file to **slack_api_token**. (Copying the token to the file is not recommended)

### Send pull request reminders in email
Configure a SMTP on your host and provide the details in the configuration file. 

# CONTRIBUTING
This started as a side project for a requirement that I had and as a way to improve my Python skills. I would warmly welcome any Pull requests and feature requests that you may have. Thanks
