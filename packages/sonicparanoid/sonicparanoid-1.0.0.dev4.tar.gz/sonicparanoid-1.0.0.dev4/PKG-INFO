        Description
        ===========
        
        SonicParanoid is a stand-alone software for the identification of orthologous relationships among multiple species. SonicParanoid is an open source software released under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 3.0 (GPLv3), implemented in Python3, Cython, and C++, and working on Linux and Mac OSX. The software is designed to run using multiple processors and proved to be up to 1245X faster then InParanoid, 166X faster than Proteinortho, and 172X faster than OrthoFinder 2.0 with an accuracy comparable to that of well-established orthology inference tools. Thanks to its speed, accuracy, and usability SonicParanoid substantially relieves the difficulties of orthology inference for biologists who need to construct and maintain their own genomic datasets.
        
        SonicParanoid was tested on a benchmark proteome dataset provided by the Quest for Orthologs (QfO) consortium (https://questfororthologs.org), and its accuracy was assessed, and compared to that of other 13 methods, using a publicly available orthology benchmarking service (Altenhoff et al. 2016).\newline
