Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI, CGI-I)
----------------------------------------------

The CGI rates illness severity, global improvement, and the
efficacy/side-effect balance of treatment. The CGI-I is a subset with just the
improvement subscale.

Guy (1976), as above.

A trivial modification has been made: questions are asked about therapeutic
effect and side effects separately, and are then combined to give the same
score as the original CGI method (which required a simultaneous rating on those
two dimensions).
