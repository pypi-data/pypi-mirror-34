ofxstatement-revolut
====================

This is a plugin for use with ofxstatement package. It implements
a parser for the Revolut CSV-formatted bank statement.

The CSV isn't very machine readable, so we need to do some ugly string
parsing to figure out the different field values.

Issue reports and pull requests welcome.

This module is based on the Osuuspankki ofxstatement parser found at
