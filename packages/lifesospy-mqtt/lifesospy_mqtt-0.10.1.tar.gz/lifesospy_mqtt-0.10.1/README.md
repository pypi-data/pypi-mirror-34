# LifeSOS MQTT Client

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/lifesospy_mqtt.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/lifesospy_mqtt)

This application provides an MQTT client that interfaces with
[LifeSOS](http://lifesos.com.tw) alarm systems, sensors and switches.
It will publish the state of all devices to an MQTT broker, which can
then be consumed by any application that provides MQTT support, such
as Home Assistant or OpenHAB. It will also subscribe to topics on the
broker that allow the control of the alarm system (eg. arm, disarm)
and turn on/off any attached switches.

It was written for & tested with the LS-30 model, though it should also
work on the LS-10/LS-20 models. Note that in some markets, they may also
be labelled under the name of the distributor; eg. SecurePro in
Australia, WeBeHome in northern Europe.

## Requirements

- A network-connected LifeSOS LS-30, LS-20 or LS-10 alarm system.
- Something to run this application on. Assuming you want to leave it
running 24/7, a low-powered device like a Raspberry Pi or a NAS are ideal.
- [Python 3.5.3 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be
installed.
- An MQTT broker to connect to; eg. [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)

## Setting Up

To install this application, run the following command:

    $ pip install lifesospy_mqtt
