Description: # Asip serial manager for python
        A Python client for the ASIP protocol.
        Client should support both Python 2.7 and 3. Anyway, compatibility issues may still exist.
        Package allows to communicate with MirtoRobot via serial port as well as TCP connection, using a bridge on a robot, 
        and source files on remote host.
        This package can be installed directly on Raspberry Pi or other computer.
