A Python wrapper for the Disney API. Data is pulled directly from Disney.
Yeah you could look at the code and figure it out yourself, but here's a library incase you're lazy.

If you needs something specific from the API open a new issue with a "feature request" label.

The creation of this was for a project I created called [WDWWaits](https://github.com/scaratozzolo/WDWWaits). Some parts of the wrapper were created with that in mind. The goal was to create a data set of the Walt Disney World wait times to perform analysis on at some point. The program now incorporates Disneyland as well.
