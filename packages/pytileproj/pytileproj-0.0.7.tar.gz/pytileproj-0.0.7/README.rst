A python class for working with TiledProjectionSystems (TPS).


Description
===========

It's a python package that handles the geometric and geographic operations of a gridded and tiled projection system.
It was designed for data cubes ingesting satellite imagery and builds the basis for the Equi7Grid (see https://github
.com/TUW-GEO/Equi7Grid).

It also includes a nice and handy realisation of the UTM/UPS grid system, using the TiledProjectionSystems (TPS) approach.
