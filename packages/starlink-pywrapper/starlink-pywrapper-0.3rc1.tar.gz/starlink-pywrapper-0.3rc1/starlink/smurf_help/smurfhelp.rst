Navigating The Help Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The help information is arranged hierarchically. You can move around
the help information whenever SMURFHELP prompts. This occurs when it
has either presented a screen's worth of text or has completed
displaying the previously requested help. The information displayed by
SMURFHELP on a particular topic includes a description of the topic
and a list of subtopics that further describe the topic.
At a prompt you may enter:

+ a topic and/or subtopic name(s) to display the help for that topic
or subtopic, so for example, "block parameters box" gives help on BOX,
which is a subtopic of Parameters, which in turn is a subtopic of
BLOCK;
+ a <CR> to see more text at a "Press RETURN to continue ..." request;
+ a <CR>} at topic and subtopic prompts to move up one level in the
hierarchy, and if you are at the top level it will terminate the help
session;
+ a CTRL/D (pressing the CTRL and D keys simultaneously) in response
to any prompt will terminate the help session;
+ a question mark "?" to redisplay the text for the current topic,
including the list of topic or subtopic names; or
+ an ellipsis "..." to display all the text below the current point in
  the hierarchy. For example, "BLOCK..." displays information on the
  BLOCK topic as well as information on all the subtopics under BLOCK.

You can abbreviate any topic or subtopic using the following rules.


+ Just give the first few characters, e.g. "PARA" for Parameters.
+ Some topics are composed of several words separated by underscores.
Each word of the keyword may be abbreviated, e.g. "Colour_Set" can be
shortened to "C_S".
+ The characters "%" and "*" act as wildcards, where the percent sign
matches any single character, and asterisk matches any sequence of
characters. Thus to display information on all available topics, type
an asterisk in reply to a prompt.
+ If a word contains, but does end with an asterisk wildcard, it must
not be truncated.
+ The entered string must not contain leading or embedded spaces.

Ambiguous abbreviations result in all matches being displayed.
