isogeometric_application (IA) is an extension of KRATOS Multiphysics framework to assist isogeometric analysis with multipatch NURBS, hierarchical B-Splines and T-Splines. IA uses the Bezier decomposition concept to retain the local characteristics of the standard finite element. With this design, IA can interoperably work with other KRATOS applications.
