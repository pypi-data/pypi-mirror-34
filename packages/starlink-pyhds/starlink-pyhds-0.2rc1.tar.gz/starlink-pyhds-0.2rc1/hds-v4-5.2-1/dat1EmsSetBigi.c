*  Name:
*     dat1EmsSetBigi

*  Purpose:
*     Set message token for INT_BIG integer.

*  Invocation:
*     dat1EmsSetBigi( const char * token, INT_BIG value );

*  Description :
*     Version of emsSeti suitable for the INT_BIG internal HDS type.

*  Parameters :
*     token = const char * (Given)
*        Message token to use.
*     value = INT_BIG (Given)
*        Value to store in token.

*  Notes:
*     This routine should be called instead of emsSeti if an INT_BIG
*     is to be stored in a token.
