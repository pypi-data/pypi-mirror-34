Overview
--------
This software provides a library of miscellaneous utilities for Python.
It is relatively easy to extend and users are encouraged to tweak with it.

Most of the code is used is used in a number of projects

As a result of the code maturity, some of the library components may undergo
(eventually heavy) refactoring, although this is currently unexpected.
