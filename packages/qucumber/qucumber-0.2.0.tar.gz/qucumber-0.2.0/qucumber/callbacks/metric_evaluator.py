    """Evaluate and hold on to the results of the given metric(s).

    This Callback is called at the end of each epoch.

    .. note::
        Since Callbacks are given to :func:`fit<qucumber.rbm.BinomialRBM.fit>`
        as a list, they will be called in a deterministic order. It is
        therefore recommended that instances of
        :class:`MetricEvaluator<MetricEvaluator>` be the first callbacks in
        the list passed to :func:`fit<qucumber.rbm.BinomialRBM.fit>`,
        as one would often use it in conjunction with other callbacks like
        :class:`EarlyStopping<EarlyStopping>` which may depend on
        :class:`MetricEvaluator<MetricEvaluator>` having been called.

    :param period: Frequency with which the callback evaluates the given
                   metric(s).

    :param metrics: A dictionary of callables where the keys are the names of
                    the metrics and the callables take the RBM being trained
                    as their positional argument, along with some keyword
                    arguments. The metrics are evaluated and put into a
                    dictionary structure resembling the structure of `metrics`.
                    If one of the callables returns a dictionary,
                    the keys of that dictionary will be suitably modified
                    and will be merged with the metric dictionary.
