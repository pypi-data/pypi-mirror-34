COPE Inventory (brief version)
------------------------------

History and guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

“The COPE Inventory was developed to assess a broad range of coping responses,
several of which had an explicit basis in theory. The inventory includes some
responses that are expected to be dysfunctional, as well as some that are
expected to be functional. It also includes at least 2 pairs of polar­opposite
tendencies. These were included because each scale is unipolar (the absence of
this response does not imply the presence of its opposite), and because we
think people engage in a wide range of coping during a given period, including
both of each pair of opposites.

“The items have been used in at least 3 formats. One is a "dispositional" or
trait­like version in which respondents report the extent to which they usually
do the things listed, when they are stressed. A second is a time­limited
version in which respondents indicate the degree to which they actually did
have each response during a particular period in the past. The third is a
time-­limited version in which respondents indicate the degree to which they
have been having each response during a period up to the present. The formats
differ in their verb forms: the dispositional format is present tense, the
situational­-past format is past tense, the third format is present tense
progressive (I am ...) or present perfect (I have been ...).” (Charles S.
