FROM-LP additional scales (CGI-I, IRAC, PSS, FFT, RSS)
------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_from_lp_generic.rst

The FROM-LP generic measures include:

- CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale (Guy W, 1976); see
  :ref:`CGI <cgi>`.

- CORE-10 — but while paper copies are free, electronic reproduction is not:
  see http://www.coreims.co.uk/copyright.pdf; therefore, not part of CamCOPS.

- Friends and Family Test (FFT) (Department of Health, 2012).

- IRAC: Identify and Rate the Aim of the Contact (Trigwell P, 2014a).

- Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS) (Persaud A et al. 2008).

- Referrer Satisfaction Scale (RSS) (Trigwell P, 2014b, after Persaud A et al.
  2008).

  - CamCOPS supports two versions of the RSS: a patient-specific version and
    a survey version.
