        Hask is a pure-Python, zero-dependencies library that mimics most of the core
        language tools from Haskell, including:
        
        * Full Hindley-Milner type system (with typeclasses) that will typecheck any
          function decorated with a Hask type signature
        
        * Easy creation of new algebraic data types and new typeclasses, with
          Haskell-like syntax
        
        * Pattern matching with `case` expressions
        
        * Automagical function currying/partial application and function composition
        
        * Efficient, immutable, lazily evaluated `List` type with Haskell-style list
          comprehensions
        
        * All your favorite syntax and control flow tools, including operator
          sections, monadic error handling, guards, and more
        
        * Python port of (some of) the standard libraries from Haskell's `base`,
          including:
        
          * Algebraic datatypes from the Haskell `Prelude`, including `Maybe` and
            `Either`
        
          * Typeclasses from the Haskell `base` libraries, including `Functor`,
            `Applicative`, `Monad`, `Enum`, `Num`, and all the rest
        
          * Standard library functions from `base`, including all functions from
            `Prelude`, `Data.List`, `Data.Maybe`, and more
        
        
        Features not yet implemented, but coming soon:
        
        * Better support for polymorphic return values/type defaulting
        
        * Better support for lazy evaluation (beyond just the `List` type and pattern
          matching)
        
        * More of the Haskell standard library (`Control.*` libraries, QuickCheck, and
          more)
        
        * Monadic, lazy I/O
        
        .. warning:: Note that all of this is still very much pre-alpha, and some
                     things may be buggy!
