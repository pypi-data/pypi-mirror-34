        What is VXScreenshots?.
        -----------------------
        
        Basic Screenshots manager pushing and sharing automatically to Amazon S3 images
        and giving the link automatically to use them alá Skitch autoconfiguring your 
        Linux desktop environment with shutter properlly.
        
        This is a combination of tools Not a tool itself to have your Linux taking fast
        Screenshots.
        
        Why?.
        -----
        
        When you look for an alternative to `Skitch <https://evernote.com/skitch/>`_, an
        `evernote <https://evernote.com/>`_ extension which is
        pretty cool everybody mentioned `Shutter <http://shutter-project.org/>`_ 
        as the `best screenshot tool <http://askubuntu.com/questions/6558/what-screenshot-tools-are-available>`_
        on Linux (which is true) but it needs a lot of investigation and configurations to
        automate an important feature **Take the screenshot, edit it and sync it
        inmediatly with access with a direct link to embed it properlly**, even if this tool
        has some **upload features** they are full of marketing and noisy, with this
        little set of helpers in python, you can have your own server of images in
        Amazon s3 and preconfigure everything to work our of the box.
        
        See a little demonstration of what you can do.
