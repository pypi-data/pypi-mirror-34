Vivarium is a framework for microsimulation written using standard scientific Python tools.

You can install `vivarium` from PyPI with pip:

```
> pip install vivarium
```

or build it from source with

```
> git clone https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium.git
> cd vivarium
> python setup.py install
```

This will make the `vivarium` library available to python and install a command-line executable called `simulate`
that you can use to verify your installation with

```
> simulate test
```
