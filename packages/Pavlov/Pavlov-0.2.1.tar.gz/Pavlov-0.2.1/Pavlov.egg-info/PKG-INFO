Description: 
        Pavlov is a modular, composable reinforcement learning API,
        with models written in Keras with a Tensorflow backend.
        
        Use Pavlov if you want a reinforcement learning library that:
            - Allows for easy and fast composition of various
              algorithms, exploration strategies, and state preprocessors
            - Allows for arbitrarily defined custom network architectures
            - Works with any environment that follows the OpenAI Gym interface
            - Comes with its own Docker image for both GPU and CPU usage
        
        Pavlov is distributed under the MIT license.
