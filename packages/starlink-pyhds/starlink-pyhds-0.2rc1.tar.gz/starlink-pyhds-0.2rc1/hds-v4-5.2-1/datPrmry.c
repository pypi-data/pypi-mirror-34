/*
*+
*  Name:
*     DAT_PRMRY

*  Purpose:
*     Set or enquire primary/secondary locator status.

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DAT_PRMRY( SET, LOC, PRMRY, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine may be used to promote a locator to become a
*     "primary" locator, to demote it to become a "secondary" locator,
*     or to enquire about the primary/secondary status of a locator.
*     It allows control over the duration for which an HDS container
*     file remains open; each file remains open only so long as there
*     is at least one primary locator associated with it.

*  Arguments:
*     SET = LOGICAL (Given)
*        If a .TRUE. value is given for this argument, then the routine
*        will perform a "set" operation to set the primary/secondary
*        status of a locator.  Otherwise it will perform an "enquire"
*        operation to return the value of this status without changing
*        it.
*     LOC = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given and Returned)
*        The locator whose primary/secondary status is to be set or
*        enquired.
*     PRMRY = LOGICAL (Given and Returned)
*        If SET is .TRUE., then this is an input argument and specifies
*        the new value to be set (.TRUE. for a primary locator, .FALSE.
*        for a secondary locator). If SET is .FALSE., then this is an
*        output argument and will return a value indicating whether or
*        not a primary locator was supplied.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     -  The value of the LOC argument will not normally be changed.
*     However, if it is the last primary locator associated with a
*     container file, and is being demoted from a primary to a
*     secondary locator, then the container file will be left without
*     an associated primary locator. In this case, the locator supplied
*     will be annulled (along with any other secondary locators
*     associated with the same file), a value of DAT__NOLOC will be
*     returned, and the file will be closed.
*     -  The DAT__NOLOC constant is defined in the include file
*     DAT_PAR.
