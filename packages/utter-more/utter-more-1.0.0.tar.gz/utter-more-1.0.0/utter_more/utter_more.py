    def __init__(self, *utterance_templates):
        """
        A class to create utterances for a custom skill for Amazon's Alexa. It
        can be a tedious process if verbosity is desired because language is so
        flexible. So this will automatically creates all the utterances you want
        based on (a) given utterance template(s).

        There are two ways to format a template and they are as follows:

        (a*1|b*2) (c^1|d^2) - [CONDITIONAL OR] The * defines a master with a tag
            of whatever follows the * while the ^ defines a follower of the tag
            of whatever follows the ^. So utterances with a word tagged with
            ^sample will only be returned if the utterance also has a word
            tagged with *sample. The above will display 'a c' OR 'b d'.

        For example, the template
        
        "What (is*singular|are*plural) (that^singular|those^plural) {{things}}"
        will return the following utterances:

                    ['What is that {things}',
                    'What is that',
                    'What are those {things}',
                    'What are those']

        An arbitrary number of utterance templates can be passed to the class.
        Or utterance templates can be passed as a solo argument to
        self.build_utterances.

        Parameters:
        utterance_templates - Arbitrary number of utterance templates. Their
                              respective utterance can be created by running

        Returns the made utterances given an utterance template. It supports

        (a|b|c|...) - [OR] This wil place a OR b OR c OR etc. in its place
        {{slot}} - [OPTIONAL SLOT] This will place the slot {slot} or nothing
            in its place.
        (a*1|b*2) (c^1|d^2) - [CONDITIONAL OR] The * defines a master with a tag
            of whatever follows the * while the ^ defines a follower of the tag
            of whatever follows the ^. So utterances with a word tagged with
            ^sample will only be returned if the utterance also has a word
            tagged with *sample. The above will display 'a c' OR 'b d'. If we
            have multiple masters, then the follower(s) will appear if at least
            one master is present. And alternatively, you can treat multiple 
            followers as a CONDITIONAL AND.
