# Usage

To work with queue we need ```asyncpg``` library
```python
import asyncpg

conn = await asyncpg.connect('postgresql://postgres@localhost/test')
```

```QueueFabric.find_queue``` method will create needed 
tables in database if it is new queue. 
Also it has ```is_exists_queue``` method for situations when you 
need to know that it will be the new queue
```python
from async_pq import Queue, QueueFabric

queue: Queue = await QueueFabric(conn).find_queue('items')
```

Put new items (dumped JSONs) in queue
```python
await queue.put('{"id":1,"data":[1,2,3]}', '{"id":2,"data":[3,2,6]}')
```

Pop items from queue with some ```limit```. It is possible to use acknowledge pattern
```python
# If with_ack=False, massage will be acknowledged in place automatically
request_id, data = await queue.pop(limit=2, with_ack=True)
```

Acknowledge request
```python
await queue.ack(request_id)
```

Or vice versa 
```python
await queue.unack(request_id)
```

Return to queue all unacknowledged massages older than ```timeout``` seconds 
```python
await queue.return_unacked(timeout=300)
```

Clean queue (delete all acknowledged massages)
```python
await queue.clean_acked_queue()
```
