cache-magic
===========

This package adds ``%cache`` line-magic to Jupyter notebooks.

Warning!!!
----------

The author of this Python package makes no commitment to maintain it. It
was forked from `this
project <https://github.com/SmartDataInnovationLab/ipython-cache>`__ and
you’re probably better off using that! That said, if you like the tweaks
I made (added compression, bug fixes, style preferences, etc.), feel
free to use it how you see fit. Just be sure to respect the original
author’s license (see LICENSE copied
`here <https://github.com/pyython/cache-magic/blob/master/LICENSE>`__
for your convenience).

Quickstart
----------

-  The pip-package is called ``cache-magic``
-  The python module is called ``cache_magic``
-  The magic is called ``%cache``

So you can run the magic by entering this into an Jupyter cell:

.. code:: python

   !pip install cache-magic
   import cache_magic
   %cache a = 1+1
   %cache

installation
============

install directly from notebook
------------------------------

1. open jupyter notebook
2. create new cell
3. enter ``!pip install cache-magic``
4. execute

install into conda-environment
------------------------------

.. code:: bash

   conda create -n test
   source activate test
   conda install -c pyython cache-magic
   jupyter notebook

usage
=====

Activate the magic by loading the module like any other module. Write
into a cell ``import cache_magic`` and excecute it.

When you want to apply the magic to a line, just prepend the line with
``%cache``

example
-------

::

   %cache myVar = someSlowCalculation(some, "parameters")

This will calculate ``someSlowCalculation(some, "parameters")`` once.
And in subsequent calls it restores myVar from storage.

The magic turns this example into something like this (if there was no
ipython-kernel and no versioning):

.. code:: python

   try:
     with open("myVar.pkl.gz", 'rb') as fp:
       myVar = pickle.loads(zlib.decompress(fp.read()))
   except:
     myVar = someSlowCalculation(some, "parameters")
     with open("myVar.pkl.gz", 'wb') as fp:
       fp.write(zlib.compress(pickle.dumps(myVar)))

general form
------------

::

   %cache <variable> = <expression>

**Variable**: This Variable’s value will be fetched from cache.

**Expression**: This will only be excecuted once and the result will be
stored to disk.

full form
---------

::

   %cache [--version <version>] [--reset] [--debug] variable [= <expression>]

**-v or –version**: either a variable name or an integer. Whenever this
changes, a new value is calculated (instead of returning an old value
from the cache).

if version is ‘\*’ or omitted, the hashed expression is used as version,
so whenever the expression changes, a new value is cached.

**-r or –reset**: delete the cached value for this variable. Forces
recalculation, if ``<expression>`` is present

**-d or –debug**: additional logging

show cache
----------

.. code:: python

   %cache

shows all variables in cache as html-table

full reset
----------

.. code:: python

   %cache -r
   %cache --reset

deletes all cached values for all variables

where is the cache stored?
--------------------------

In the directory where the kernel was started (usually where the
notebook is located) in a subfolder called ``.cache``

developer Notes
===============

push to pypi
------------

prepare environment:

.. code:: bash

   gedit ~/.pypirc
   chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
   sudo apt install pandoc

upload changes to test and production:

.. code:: bash

   pandoc -o README.rst README.md
   restview --pypi-strict README.rst
   # update version in setup.py
   rm -r dist
   python setup.py sdist
   twine upload dist/* -r testpypi
   firefox https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/cache-magic
   twine upload dist/*

test install from testpypi

.. code:: bash

   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple cache-magic --no-cache-dir --user

test installation

.. code:: bash

   sudo pip install cache-magic --no-cache-dir --user

editable import
---------------

Install into environment with ``-e``:

.. code:: python

   !pip install -e .

reload after each change:

.. code:: bash

   import cache_magic
   from imp import reload
   reload(cache_magic)

Alternatively (if you don’t want to install python, jupyter & co), you
can use the docker-compose.yml for development:

.. code:: bash

   cd cache-magic
   docker-compose up

create Conda Packet
-------------------

requires the bash with latest anaconda on path

.. code:: bash

   bash
   mkdir test && cd test
   conda skeleton pypi cache-magic
   conda config --set anaconda_upload yes
   conda-build cache-magic -c conda-forge

running tests
-------------

.. code:: bash

   bash
   conda remove --name test --all
   conda env create -f test/environment.yml
   source activate test
   conda remove cache-magic
   pip uninstall cache-magic
   pip install -e .
   ./test/run_example.py

If there is any error, it will be printed to stderr and the script
fails.

the output can be found in “test/temp”.
