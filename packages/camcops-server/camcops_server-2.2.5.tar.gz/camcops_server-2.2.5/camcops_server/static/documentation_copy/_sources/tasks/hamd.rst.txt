Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) / Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD, HAM-D)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CamCOPS provides the full HAMD (= HRDS = HRSD) and the abbreviated HAMD-7.

History and guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See Hamilton (1960), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14399272, and NINDS CDE
on HAM-D,
http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/CRFs/Hamilton%20Depression%20Rating%20Scale%20(HDRS).pdf?CrfId=F0807.

Also Hamilton (1967), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6080235, and Williams
(1988) for the SIGH-D, the structured interview
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3395203).

The first 17 items constitute the HDRS-17. The last 4 items are intended to
subtype the depression, not rate its severity.

Scoring consensus: from
http://www.cnsforum.com/clinicalresources/ratingscales/ratingpsychiatry/depression/

The 7-item abbreviated version is by McIntyre et al. (2005),
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16301700.
