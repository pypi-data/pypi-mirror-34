Install

SSR-viz in implemented as a standalone GUI framework. It is entirely
written in Python 3 and therefore the easiest way to obtain it is trough
PIP - the official python repository.

Additionally we implemented standalone executables for Windows (tested
on windows 10) and Linux (tested on Ubunt 16.04). These a much bigger
then the pure python module, but ship everything needed out of the Box.

The only external tool needed is mafft, an excellent alignment tool
which is required to map protein structure indices to the alignment.
SSR-viz runs without mafft, but for the **Add\_pdb** tool the mafft
executable needs to be assigned (see section \[add\_p\]).

Getting started
===============

The SSR-viz algorithm is based on a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
file in FASTA format, which can be generated with various tools, such as
Clustalo and Mafft or with a Webserver such as ().

The topic of sequence alignment is beyond the scope of this manual.
Nevertheless one should keep in mind that the quality of the alignment
is crucial for the detection algorithm. (Is is difficult to interpret
the importance of a position, which has more gaps then amino acids.)

The first step is the classification of the sequences into subfamilies.
This is undoubtedly the most difficult part, as it often requires to
identify the specific functionality based on scientific literature or
even undertake experimental validation. Dedicated databases such as can
help to identify detailed protein functionality.

Even though there are various tools available that can cluster protein
sequences, these clustering methods always apply some kind of similarity
scoring, which leads in most cases to a clustering based on evolutionary
relationship rather then functional similarity. This is demonstrated on
an example in section \[example\].

Ones you collected the class information of your sequences you can add
them to your alignment. The **CSV\_Builder** tool allows to creates a
comma separated value (CSV) file which can be used to add the class
label to the sequences (see section \[csv\_b\]).

An alignment and the CSV file is everything thats needed to detect
subfamily specific residues in the sequences. The **SSR\_plot** tool
handles the actual execution of the detection algorithm, the output can
be a mathplotlib style plot (see section \[ssr\_p\]) as pdf, a Javlview
annotation file (which can show the results together with the alignment)
as well as a ’stats.csv’ file which summarizes the SSRs.

In many cases it is desired to observe the SSRs inside a protein
structure (if available). Therefore, we also developed a tool
**Add\_pdb** which allows to map the indices of a protein structure file
(\*.pdb) to the indices of the alignment in the ”stats.csv’ file (see
section \[add\_p\])

An overview chart which explains the setup of the three tools is shown
in figure 

CSV builder {#csv_b}
===========

The **CSV\_Builder** handles the input and takes care, that the
alignment and CSV class label file have the right formating.

The mapping scheme is shown in Fig. .

Arguments
---------

`Input sequence alignment file`

:   \
    The alignment file with the sequences of the family. The deisred
    format is in FASTA fromat (clustalo), see section \[example\] for
    an example.

`Inplace FASTA conversion / Temporary alignment file name`

:   \
    The **CSV\_Builder** routine will remove duplicates from the
    alignment, as multiple identical sequences will overestimate the
    importance of this subfamily. The alignment can be converted
    inplace, meaning the original alignment is overwritten or a new
    alignment can be created.

`Regex extraction of the class label`

:   \
    The normal **CSV\_Builder** routine will create a CSV file, with an
    empty column for the class labels. Which must be manually filled. In
    some cases the class label is part of the sequence names, this
    labels can be extracted using regular expressions (regex) patterns.
    The entire scope of regex is to big for this manual, but the set of
    examples in the appendix \[appendix\] should help to get started.
    There are various tools available which can be used to test regex
    before usage, most text editors support regex as a search option.
    You can for example load the alignment file into sublime or notepad,
    then search with regex and if the pattern is correct, it should only
    highlight the desired class label. An example is shown
    in appendix \[appendix\].

`Output`

:   \
    The name of the CSV file, by default it will be created in the same
    folder as the sequence file.

`Delete`

:   \
    Allows to overwrite existing CSV files.
