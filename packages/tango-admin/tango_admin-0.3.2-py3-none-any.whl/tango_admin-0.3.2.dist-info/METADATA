Tango Admin
=====

Tango Admin is a collection of simple admin helpers for Django apps.

It includes:
* A responsive admin theme (at least, a lazy first pass at one)
* An admin menu column. Thanks to @kezabelle for the idea.
* Inlines can support a link to the related object.
* Drag and drop tabular inlines
* A textarea length counter
* A "nuke user" function

And some other minor improvements. It can be used with or without other Tango apps.
