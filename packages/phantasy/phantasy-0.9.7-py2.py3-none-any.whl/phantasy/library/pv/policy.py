"""Read and write policy for PVs. The policy for PV read and write is a
defined function, for which the input parameters are:

* read: `readback_pv` attribute as argument, return a value;
* write: `setpoint_pv` attribute and new value(s) as arguments;

`readback_pv` and `setpoint_pv` are both instantiated from `epics.PV`,
the value of PV could be reached by `.value`, while setting new value by
`.put()` method.

All input PV parameters are list type, while value for writing is a scalar.
