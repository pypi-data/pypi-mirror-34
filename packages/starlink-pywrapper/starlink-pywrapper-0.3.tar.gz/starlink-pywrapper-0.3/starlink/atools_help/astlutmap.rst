ASTLUTMAP
=========


Purpose
~~~~~~~
Create a LutMap


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This application creates a new LutMap and optionally initialises its
attributes. A LutMap is a specialised form of Mapping which transforms
1-dimensional coordinates by using linear interpolation in a lookup
table.
Each input coordinate value is first scaled to give the index of an
entry in the table by subtracting a starting value (the input
coordinate corresponding to the first table entry) and dividing by an
increment (the difference in input coordinate value between adjacent
table entries).
The resulting index will usually contain a fractional part, so the
output coordinate value is then generated by interpolating linearly
between the appropriate entries in the table. If the index lies
outside the range of the table, linear extrapolation is used based on
the two nearest entries (i.e. the two entries at the start or end of
the table, as appropriate).
If the lookup table entries increase or decrease monotonically, then
the inverse transformation may also be performed.


Usage
~~~~~


::

    
       astlutmap lut start inc options result
       



ADAM parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



FMT = LITERAL (Read)
````````````````````
The format in which to store output objects. Can be "AST", "XML",
"STCS", or any FitsChan encoding such as FITS-WCS. Only used if the
output object is written to a text file. An error is reported if the
output object cannot be written using the requested format. ["AST"]



INC = _DOUBLE (Read)
````````````````````
The lookup table spacing (the increment in input coordinate value
between successive lookup table entries). This value may be positive
or negative, but must not be zero.



LUT = GROUP (Read)
``````````````````
A comma-separated list of floating point values to be used as the
lookup table entries. A text file may be specified by preceeding the
name of the file with an up arrow character "^". If the supplied value
ends with a minus sign, the user is re-prompted for additional values.



OPTIONS = LITERAL (Read)
````````````````````````
A string containing an optional comma-separated list of attribute
assignments to be used for initialising the new LutMap.



RESULT = LITERAL (Read)
```````````````````````
A text file to receive the new LutMap.



START = _DOUBLE (Read)
``````````````````````
The input coordinate value which corresponds to the first lookup table
entry.
