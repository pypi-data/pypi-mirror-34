        Sphinx Version Warning Extension
        ================================
        
        
        Sphinx Version Warning is a Sphinx_ extension that allows you to show a *Warning* banner at the top of your documentation.
        The banner is shown based on the version that is displayed compared (using SemVer_) with the latest version on the server.
        
        This extension was originally created to be compatible with `Read the Docs`_ API and currently it's the only backend that supports
        (inspired by https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/3481#issuecomment-378000845)
        
        .. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/
        .. _SemVer: https://semver.org/
        .. _Read the Docs: http://readthedocs.org/
        
        
        How it works?
        -------------
        
        When visiting a page in Read the Docs that was built with this extension enabled,
        an AJAX request is done to the Read the Docs servers to retrieve all the versions of the project.
        These versions are compared against the one that we are reading and if it's an old version,
        a red *Warning* banner appears at the top of the page.
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        .. image:: warning-example.png
        
        There is a live example living at Read the Docs:
        
        - `latest`_ version doesn't show any kind of warning banner
        - `0.0.1`_ version shows a custom and fixed message added at build time
        - `0.0.2`_ version shows a warning banner saying that 0.0.3 is available (at the time of writing this docs)
        - `0.0.3`_ version doesn't show any banner since it's the latest version (at the time of writing this docs)
        
        
        .. _latest: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        .. _0.0.1: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.1/
        .. _0.0.2: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.2/
        .. _0.0.3: https://sphinx-version-warning-example.readthedocs.io/en/0.0.3/
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Just run this ``pip`` command insider your virtualenv::
        
           pip install sphinx-version-warning
        
        
        Then in your ``conf.py`` you have to add ``versionwarning`` in the ``extensions`` list. Should be similar to::
        
          extensions = [
              'versionwarning',
          ]
        
        
        Remember to configure the ``version`` of your Sphinx project since it's the key for this to work properly::
        
          version = '0.0.1'
        
        .. warning::
        
           If ``READTHEDOCS_VERSION`` variable is defined, the extension will use its value.
           Otherwise, ``versionwarning_project_version`` will be used and if it's not defined, ``version`` as last resource.
        
        
        Customization
        -------------
        
        Some customization can be done using the ``conf.py`` file of your Sphinx project:
        
        versionwarning_default_admonition_type (string)
           type of admonition for the banner (warning, admonition or note)
        
        versionwarning_default_message (string)
           default message for the warning banner
        
        versionwarning_messages (dict)
           mapping between versions and messages for its banners
        
        versionwarning_message_placeholder (string)
           text to be replaced by the version number link from the message
        
        versionwarning_project_slug (string)
           slug of the project under Read the Docs (default to ``READTHEDOCS_PROJECT`` environment variable)
        
        versionwarning_project_version (string)
           slug of the version for the current documentation (default to ``READTHEDOCS_VERSION`` environment variable or ``version`` variable from ``conf.py``)
        
        versionwarning_api_url (string)
           API URL to retrieve all versions for this project
        
        versionwarning_banner_html (string)
           HTML code used for the banner shown
        
        versionwarning_banner_id_div (string)
           HTML element ID used for the <div> inject as banner
        
        versionwarning_body_default_selector (string)
           jQuery selector to find the body element in the page
        
        versionwarning_body_extra_selector (string)
           jQuery selector to find the body element in the page if ``versionwarning_body_default_selector`` wasn't found
