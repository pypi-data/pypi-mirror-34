        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.polls`` to the list of eggs to
           install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.polls
        
        #. If you are using Plone 4.2 you need to add the following also::
        
            [versions]
            ...
            collective.js.jqueryui = 1.8.16.9
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ''collective.polls'' and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
            in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Features
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        - Polls can be opened for anonymous users to vote
        - If an open poll is allowed for anonymous but is inside a private folder,
          nobody can vote. Therefore the poll's parent folder needs to be published
          before opening the poll in order for this field to take effect
        - Voting can take place either in the object or in a voting portlet;
        - The voting portlet can show the latest open poll or ab specific open poll
          and closed polls
        - Users can see partial results of the poll
        - Results can be shown using a bar chart, a pie chart, or just by number of
          votes
        - Polls can have relations with other content in the site
        
        Workflow description
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The workflow associated with polls has the following states: 'Private',
        'Pending review', 'Open' and 'Closed'.
        
        - Polls are created in 'Private' state; only Owner, Manager, Editor or Site
          Administrator roles can modify them.
        
        - When a poll is in 'Private' state it can be sent to 'Pending review' or
          directly to 'Open' state, if the user has the proper role (Reviewer, Manager
          or Site Administrator).
        
        - When a poll is in 'Pending review' state it can be edited by Manager,
          Editor, Reviewer or Site Administrator roles.
        
        - A poll in 'Pending review' state can be sent to 'Open' state, with "Review
          portal content" permission, or to Private, with "Request review" permission.
        
        - When the poll is 'Open' users can only vote; nobody can modify the poll in
          any way.
        
        - An 'Open' poll can be sent to 'Private' or 'Closed' state by Reviewer,
          Manager or Site Administrator roles.
        
        - When an 'Open' poll is sent to 'Private', all votes are removed to avoid
          data manipulation.
        
        - When a poll is in 'Closed' state nobody can modify it, nor can anyone vote
          on it; a closed poll can always be reopened by usera with proper
          permissions.
        
        Not entirely unlike
        -------------------
        
        `Plone PoPoll`_
            A very old an unmaintained product, PoPoll includes a poll tool that
            allows member or anonymous to vote for one or more answers. A portlet is
            provided. It can be configured to display the last poll, or the first poll
            of a folder. After the vote statistics screens are shown.

        .. Warning::
            This release removes code for old upgrade steps;
            upgrading from a version below 1.8 is no longer supported.
            This version removes tile registration/removal;
            you must depend on plone.app.tiles >= 3.0.0 to avoid issues with ``collective.polls`` tile.
        
        - Add dependency on z3c.caching to implement automatic purging on poll modified, moved, renamed or removed.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Update i18n, Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish translations.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix HTTP caching headers on ``update-poll`` browser view (fixes `#117 <https://github.com/collective/collective.polls/issues/117>`_);
          a poll now updates its modification date on every vote.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Upgrade steps 2, 3 and 4 were removed.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Remove needless tile registration/removal when using plone.app.tiles >= 3.0.0.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Fix removal of portlet definition.
          [hvelarde]

          [SyZn]

        1.10b1 (2017-06-16)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. Warning::
            This release removes collective.z3cform.widgets from the list of dependencies;
            so, it would be a good idea to add this package on the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration before upgrading to avoid ending with a broken dependency.
            After running the upgrade step you can safely uninstall collective.z3cform.widgets and remove it from your buildout configuration if you don't have any other add-on depending on it.
        
        - Remove ExplorerCanvas script;
          this will break compatibility with IE8 and below but... who cares?
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Remove dependency on collective.z3cform.widgets.
          [sneridagh, hvelarde]
        
        - Add Catalan translation.
          [sneridagh]
        
        - Remove hard dependency on five.grok.

        - Remove soft dependency on zope.formlib under Plone 5 (HT @ale-rt).
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Do not fail while adding a portlet under Plone 5 (closes `#106`_).
          [hvelarde]
        
        
        1.9b1 (2016-09-29)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

            Be sure to read the whole changelog and apply the related changes to your buildout configuration while upgrading.
            Also, note that this is the first release marked as compatible with Plone 5;
            it still has some issues and must not be used in production with that version.
        
        - Package is now compatible with Plone 5.0 and Plone 5.1.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - Remove hard dependency on plone.app.referenceablebehavior as Archetypes is no longer the default framework in Plone 5.
          Under Plone < 5.0 you should now explicitly add it to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration to avoid issues while upgrading.
          [hvelarde]

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        - Depend on plone.api.
          [hvelarde]

        - Fix refreshing the portlet.  Previously no html would be returned
          when the portlet was defined on a default page.  The refresh would
          fail with a ComponentLookupError when used inside a panel of
          collective.panels.
          [maurits]
