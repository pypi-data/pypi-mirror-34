Description: =======================
        Planet GEE Pipeline CLI
        =======================
        
        While moving between assets from Planet Inc and Google Earth Engine it was imperative to create a pipeline that allows for easy transitions between the two service end points and this tool is designed to act as a step by step process chain from Planet Assets to batch upload and modification within the Google Earth Engine environment. The ambition is apart from helping user with batch actions on assets along with interacting and extending capabilities of existing GEE CLI. It is developed case by case basis to include more features in the future as it becomes available or as need arises. You can access the `readme file here <https://github.com/samapriya/Planet-GEE-Pipeline-CLI/blob/master/README.md>`_

        ``````
        * Major improvements to ingestion using manifest ingest in Google Earth Engine
        * Contains manifest for all commonly used Planet Data item and asset combinations
        * Added additional tool to Earth Engine Enhancement including quota check before upload to GEE

        * Added capability to query download size and local disk capacity before downloading planet assets.
        * Added the list function to generate list of collections or folders including reports
        * Added the collection size tool which allows you to estimate total size or quota used from your allocated quota.
        * ogr2ft feature is removed since Earth Engine now allows vector and table uploading.
